Among those arrested were three Zimbabweans who have been working at World Navi motors along Ngong Road."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They were deported Tuesday morning.</p><p>The immigration officials named the three as Stanley Makombe and his two sons Trevor Tadiwanaishe and Trevor Tanaka who have been working at the firm as sales managers.</p><p>Two Japanese Yusuke Tamano and Yoshifumi Sawada who were the targets vanished, officials said.</p><p>They are being sought. The three Zimbabweans were detained at Kilimani police cells ahead of the deportation for working without work permits.</p><p>Kilimani police commander Moss Ndiwa said the operation was conducted by immigration and that they had been taken out of the country.</p><p>“Those are immigration issues and the suspects are held in cells ahead of other procedures including deportation which I understand has taken place,” he said.</p><p>The three apparently replaced Philippine national Lianie Beth Gala at the yard who was deported in 2020 over claims of money laundering.</p><p>Earlier, the officials had raised Al-Shujah motors in search for the Pakistani owner Hussain Jarrar in vain.</p><p>Instead they arrested his accountant identified as only Yassin. He was released on bond and told to report back to immigration offices on Tuesday for further grilling.</p><p>Jarrar is yet to be found after it emerged his work permit had expired but he is still operating in the country.</p><p>Kenyan security agencies are investigating the wealthy Pakistan national over claims of money laundering and drug trafficking.</p><p>Jarrar, 48 is in hiding after learning he is being spotlighted over his immigration status in the country.</p><p>Jarrar who arrived in the country in 2006 and was later employed as a sales motor vehicle agent is now suddenly a billionaire.</p><p>This has raised eyebrows of the government agencies.</p><p>Jarrar’s work permit expired last year in November.</p><p>He is currently building a Sh1.2 billion mall. He was initially employed as a sales official at Al-Husnain Motors in the city where he earned Sh70,000 up to 2013.</p><p>According to investigations, he has suddenly become a billionaire.</p><p>The Directorate of Criminal Investigations, the Financial Reporting Centre, the Immigration Department and the National Intelligence Service are among agencies investigating him.</p><p>Correspondences seen between the agencies on him show he is involved in questionable deals. He has denied the claims.</p><p>His mobile phone rang unanswered but a woman who responded later on denied the claims adding Jarrar is around and will cooperate with authorities.</p><p>One agency wrote to the other in May 2022 explaining how the man arrived in the country.<br>Jarrar is currently a director at Al-Shujah Motors Limited, which was established in 2012 and started operations of selling second-hand vehicles in January 2013.</p><p>“Previously, Jarrar was a director at Al-Husnain Motors Limited and obtained three of his previous work permits from February 18, 2006 to February 2, 2013. Later the directors of Al-Husnain Motors split and hence the establishment of Al-Shujah Motors Limited by Jarrar,” said part of the letter dated May 19, 2022.</p><p>He in June 2016 made an application as a permanent resident through lawful status which was pending for five years, the documents show.</p><p>In June 2021 he applied for his citizenship by lawful residence when it was established he had an adverse notice due to his suspicious involvement with Iranians.</p><p>“Due to this, his permanent residence process was halted,” the documents say.</p><p>A report by one of the security agencies seen says the company Jarrar runs has been associated with drug trafficking.</p><p>“The referred Al-Shujah Motors changed its name from Al-Husnain Motors whose directors have been associated with drug trafficking,” read part of the report.</p><p>This came out after two of his brothers who doubled as his associates were deported over the same claims of narcotics trafficking.</p><b>Email your news TIPS to Editor@kahawatungu.com or WhatsApp +254707482874</b><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmijkZ2uuK3TrqWgrV6YvK57kmaxoqWSlq%2B4scCnqmaclaW8s8DEnWSoqJWnrrW1zqdkoqScmrSiuIyipKahl6eur8DSZqSorJ%2BneqOt2ZqYq6tf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
