Matt Threatened A Guy Who Groped Sarah At A Party</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>At a party in Sydney, Australia, in February, Sarah was groped by a male fan, causing her to scream: “Don’t touch me there!” The harassment she felt caused her to leave the event early and to apologize to he fans. Matt tweeted the following about the event:&nbsp;“To the a**hole who assaulted Sarah tonight I hope to God you don’t see next week.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>At the time, it seemed like normal — if overprotective — boyfriend-like behavior. However, given what we know now, that comment was&nbsp;highly aggressive.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>2. Sarah Once Called Herself The Luckiest Girl In The World Because Of Her Relationship With Matt</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Seventeen</a>&nbsp;for their May 2012 issue, Sarah opened up about her kidney transplant surgery, telling the mag:&nbsp;“He helps me with my medication and takes me to doctor appointments and all the stuff that I need to do to take care of myself. Any other 21-year-old guy would not be there, I guarantee it. I am one of the luckiest people in the world to have him be there for me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Again, her comments sounded sweet at the time — however, it’s so hard not to imagine that Matt may have been controlling her behavior even then, if the allegations of abuse are true. Domestic violence is complicated, and many women don’t leave because they fear that no one else could or would be there for them.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>3. Matt Guest Starred In An Episode Of ‘Modern Family’</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>In Season 3 of Modern Family, Matt guest starred in “Disneyland,”&nbsp;in which the whole family visits the happiest place on earth. Matt played a would-be boyfriend of Sarah’s character, Haley Dunphy; a nephew to one of Claire Dunphy’s friends,&nbsp;Claire was trying to set them both up so that Haley could get her mind off of her ex.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>4. Matt First Met Sarah During A 2008 Audition For ‘High School Musical’</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Matt and Sarah’s romance first began back in 2008, when they met at a&nbsp;High School Musical 3 audition; he got the part of Jimmie “Rocket Man” Zara; Sarah didn’t end up getting a part.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12><strong>5. Matt & Sarah Co-Starred In ‘Geek Charming’</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Matt and Sarah played opposite each other in a Disney Channel original movie called&nbsp;Geek Charming; Sarah played a pretty, popular girl and Matt her geek in shining armor.
