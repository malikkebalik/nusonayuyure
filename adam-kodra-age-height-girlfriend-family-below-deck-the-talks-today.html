In short, he gets seasick, is afraid of water and can’t swim!</p><p>Below you will find out everything you need to know about him including his age, height, girlfriend and family.</p><h3><span id=Meet_Adam_Kodra_Sailor_Below_Deck_Season_2><b>Meet Adam Kodra, Sailor Below Deck, Season 2</b></span></h3><p>Below Deck Down Under premiered on July 17, 2023, and this time M/Y Northern Sun cruised the spectacular waters of Australia. Captain Jason Chambers and Chief Stew Aesha Scott are back for the sequel, and several new crew members have been added, including Sailor Adam Kodra, who has caused quite a stir among fans!</p><p>First, viewers were surprised by the fact that Adam has only been working in the yachting industry for a year — given the responsibilities that come with being a member of a luxury yacht crew. But it is not uncommon for crew members to have more experience before taking on such roles. However, if you combine his inexperience with his other weakness, it’s a perfect recipe for disaster.</p><p>If you missed the episode, Adam is seasick, especially considering his occupation. Dealing with seasickness while working on a yacht can be quite challenging, but somehow he coped with it. On top of that, he lacked swimming, which was indeed an unusual and potentially worrying characteristic for someone in the yachting business.</p><p>Additionally, Adam’s unprofessional behavior of leaving the deck unattended at night was a serious problem. It is common practice to have someone at anchor overnight to ensure the safety of the ship and its guests. Otherwise, dangerous situations could arise, as evidenced by the decision of unpleasant guests to go swimming at night without proper supervision.</p><p>But again, thanks to these intriguing elements in the play, Adam became the central figure in the play.</p><h3><span id=How_much_is_Adam_Kodra_worth><b>How much is Adam Kodra worth?</b></span></h3><p>Adam Kodra earned a net worth of under $250k by 2023. Reportedly, his below deck salary was around $3,500 to $4,500 per month.</p><p>Now, speaking of his profession, although it is known that Adam only had a year’s experience before he boarded the M/Y Northern Sun, it also means that he had some prior experience in sailing large bodies of water and certainly possessed talent only to steer the ships through his knowledge of the stars, like an old sailor.</p><p>Before working on ships, he worked as a waiter in Siricos.</p><p>He also said, “I was close to becoming a professional skateboarder.” Unfortunately, things didn’t work out for him. Instead, he joined a naval school, the United States Merchant Marine Academy from 2016 to 2020, thanks to the advice of his advisor.</p><p>Now he has a license that allows him to work on any ship in the world</p><p>It also means that he never intended to work at sea. But because of his weak will in school, he didn’t know where else to go.</p><p>When Adam was not working, he liked to be in society and go out to bars, clubs, shows and sports games.</p><p><b>Fun fact: </b>Adam’s favorite place to travel was Fitzroy Island in Australia.</p><h3><span id=Adam_Kodra_Girl><b>Adam Kodra Girl</b></span></h3><p>In 2023, Adam Kodra didn’t seem to date anyone. However, in Below Deck, crew members often form romantic relationships with one another as they spend a significant amount of time together in close quarters. So he could have had some affairs during his time there.</p><p>Chief Flight Attendant Aesha Scott also hinted at a possible romance between flight attendant Margot Sisson and Adam during the events of season two.</p><h3><span id=Adam_Kodra_Age><b>Adam Kodra Age</b></span></h3><p>Adam Kodra was 34 when Below Deck Down Under premiered in 2023.</p><p>However, when he filmed the series, he was a year younger.</p><h3><span id=The_Adam_Kodra_family><b>The Adam Kodra family</b></span></h3><p>Adam Kodra comes from a family of seven – parents, him, one older brother, two younger brothers and one sister.</p><p>Based on his IG pictures, it’s clear the reality star was close with each of them; especially his mother — “the only person I know who can always be right,” he said.</p><p>On Mother’s Day 2016, he took to his IG and dedicated the post, “You’ve done miracles every Thanksgiving. From bad to good times, you always had my back! All the hard work I do is to make your life better. I love you as much as I can put my hands behind my back. Happy Mother’s Day to the most wonderful human being I know.”</p><p>His family has Albanian and Italian roots.</p><p><b>Trivia: </b>Kodra Skender (born: May 1946) and Aferdita Kodra are well-known members of Adam’s family.</p><h3><span id=Height_of_Adam_Kodra><b>Height of Adam Kodra</b></span></h3><p>Adam Kodra is above 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm) tall.</p><p>Mentioning his special features, Adam has blue eyes and a ripped body.</p><h3><span id=Related_FAQs><b>Related FAQs</b></span></h3><ul><li><h4><span id=When_is_Adam_Kodrarsquos_birthday><b>When is Adam Kodra’s birthday?</b></span></h4></li></ul><p>Adam celebrates his birthday on December 31 and belongs to the Capricorn zodiac sign.</p><ul><li><h4><span id=Where_is_Adam_Kodra_from><b>Where is Adam Kodra from?</b></span></h4></li></ul><p>Adam Kodra is from Brooklyn, NY.</p><p>Last we checked, he was looking for an apartment in New York.
