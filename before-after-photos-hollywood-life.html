The&nbsp;Happiness Begins&nbsp;singer debuted his dyed buzz cut via his Instagram story on Friday, Oct. 2 and for an amazing cause: October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. He attached a sticker of a pink ribbon — the international symbol for breast cancer awareness — over the selfie, which he snapped outdoors. Keeping a bit of facial hair, Joe looked handsome as he showed off his fresh look to kick off October.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The 31-year-old has previously dyed his pair pink, rocking a hot pink version on the 2016 Grammys and a similar look some baby blue when performing on the Kids’ Choice Awards and American Music Awards the same year (perfect for this then-hit, “Cake By The Ocean”). Just last month, Joe even ditched his natural dark look and even went <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>platinum blonde</a>! Through quarantine, he opened up about needing a haircut which then-pregnant wife <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sophie Turner</strong></a>, 24, happily helped out with.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/joe-jonas-pink-hair-makeover-mega-post.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>“My wife did it and it feels a lot better than what it was a few weeks ago…I was like: ‘This is getting too much.’ I couldn’t handle it,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he confessed</a> on on radio show&nbsp;Karson & Kennedy back in May, adding he was “ready for a haircut already” before the lockdown. Unfortunately for Joe, Sophie may have cut a little too much off. “The first time I had her cut just a little hair off the back…[but then] I missing some chunks of hair in the wrong places! I decided you know what maybe just shave my head, and it’s hot here in LA so it’s much better,” he explained. Joe’s been rocking the buzz cut ever since!</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>It’s been a busy past few months for Joe, who became a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first-time dad</a> after Sophie gave birth to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their daughter <strong>Willa</strong></a> on July 27, 2020. Although the couple never publicly confirmed they were expecting, the&nbsp;Game of Thrones&nbsp;star was regularly spotted out-and-about with her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>growing baby bump</a> — and even took to Instagram on Oct. 3 to post three <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>never-before-seen pregnancy photos</a> of her own.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5xe49sZqOnlWK3sLrArGSpoZ6geqmtyKtkppmbmry3sdFmmZ6en6eybq3FrZyrZaCdvLW70mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
