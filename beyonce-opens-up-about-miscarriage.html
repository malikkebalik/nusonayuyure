And it was the best form of therapy for me, because it was the saddest thing I’ve ever been through.”</p><p>Life Is But A Dream debuts next month on HBO.</p><p>Below are the lyrics to Jay-Z’s emotional track “Glory”:</p><p><strong>Verse 1</strong><br>False alarms and false stExplainarts<br>All made better by the sound of your heart<br>All the pain of the last time<br>I prayed so hard it was the last time<br>Your mama said that you danced for her<br>Did you wiggle your hands for her?<br>Glory!
