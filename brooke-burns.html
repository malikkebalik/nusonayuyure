 “My manager and I were on the floor laughing so hard when the [bad] reviews came out,” the blond TV show host recalled. “Thank you so much for the belly laughs.”
 Sure, Burns can say that now. “DED” – which airs its season finale tomorrow at 9 p.m. – ranked among the top five most-watched series of the summer, and it has been picked up by NBC for 2003."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Also, when you’re acting, people only know you as the character. People now know me as myself.</p><p>Q: Do the contestants ever hit on you?</p><p>A: Yes. They’ll ask for a hug or a kiss. They’ll ask me to come out drinking or come party. But I think it’s in my contract that I can’t date a contestant, so it’s my safety. I’ll be like, “I would love to! But I’m not allowed.”</p><p>Q: Some of your contestants strip off their clothes. Would you ever get naked in public like that?</p><p>A: Hell, no! That’s why I’m always like, “Props to you,” with one hand on the mike and one hand covering my eyes.</p><p>Q: Who decides what you wear?</p><p>A: I have a great wardrobe stylist who goes out and grabs stuff. Halter tops, peasant tops, pants and boots. Fashion with a little edge.</p><p>Q: What’s your personal style?</p><p>A: A bit more sporty. I think women need to bring jeans and tennis shoes back into fashion. Miss Sixty [jeans] are really long, which I love.</p><p>Q: Favorite designers?</p><p>A: I love Dolce & Gabbana, Prada. I just got these great Giuseppe Zanotti shoes that look like pieces of art. They have little silver studs on a black strap.</p><p>Q: What do you wear when relaxing?</p><p>A: I like those Juicy Couture sweat suits. I like vintage shirts. I have a Care Bears T-shirt, Mickey Mouse, Wonder Woman.</p><p>Q: Do you work out?</p><p>A: Yes – I chase a 2-year-old around, so I lift and squat 24-hours-a-day.</p><p>Q: Do you follow a special diet?</p><p>A: I should more than I do. I have a really bad sweet tooth.</p><p>Q: What gives you substance?</p><p>A: My daughter. The little things become exciting again when you have a child. Bubbles, balloons, drawing hopscotch, making Jell-O, painting.</p><p>Q: What do you look for in a man?</p><p>A: I went through my whole bad-boy stage, and now I want a guy who’s smart, interesting, nice and kind.</p><p>Q: What is your most prized possession?</p><p>A: My dad’s high school ring. I put tape around [to make it smaller] and wear it out all the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2JlfXN7j3FmanBfl7%2Bwu8qeZJutoqPAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
