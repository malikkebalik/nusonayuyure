Many queries also surround her 'before modeling' days as fans look up her eyebrow and teeth as a young model.</strong></p><p><strong>Chrissy Teigen</strong> is an American <strong><a href=#>model</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>television personality</a></strong>. She started her modeling career when she made her debut in the annual Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue in 2010. Aside from her modeling gigs, she has appeared as a panelist on the syndicated daytime talk show FABLife.</p><p>She also co-hosts the musical competition series Lip Sync Battle as well as serves as a judge on the comedy competition series Bring the Funny. She is also the author of two cookbooks.</p><p>Previously, we touched on the <strong><a href=#>plastic surgery</a></strong> efforts of <strong><a href=#>Mariah Fineman</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Monica Seles</a></strong>.</p><h2>What Did Chrissy Teigen Look Like Before Plastic Surgery?</h2><p><strong>Chrissy Teigen</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@chrissyteigen</a>) is one of those rare celebrities who have openly admitted to having plastic surgery. In a society with rigid standards of beauty which has pushed almost everyone in the glam industry to the door of plastic surgery, everybody takes the aid of cosmetic alterations to modify their features to their liking based on the standards but rarely does anyone admit to it.</p><p>They all pretend to be all-natural, which in turn creates more insecurity among the public. So, it is a fresh and much welcome change when an influential person does not deny that they have gone under the knife and confesses what procedures they have undergone.</p><p>Chrissy Teigen, being one of them, has chosen to be candid and honest about the plastic surgery she had. There's almost no place for speculations about what procedures she has undergone because she has revealed most of them to the public. Almost because people still suspect she has not come forward with all the alterations she had done.</p><p>Sure enough, revealed or not, comparing her <a href=# rel=noopener>pictures</a> of when she was just getting started on her career to the current ones, you can see a change in them, which are all due to plastic surgery.</p><p>Since Chrissy Teigen career as a model began when she made her professional modeling debut in the annual Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue in 2010, more than a decade separates those pictures. Some of the changes could be time, but most of them undoubtedly are plastic surgeries.</p><p>At the start of her career, that is to say before all the plastic surgery, Chrissy Teigen had very soft features compared to now. She was olive-skinned with big and prominent cheekbones and round plump cheeks. As it turns out, she used to tan herself during those times and has said that her natural skin tone is very <a href=# rel=noopener>white</a>, almost whitish-yellow. And her nose then used to be bulkier than now.</p><p>Chrissy Teigen had full and fine lips but she seems to not have been satisfied with them because she has much-swollen lips now, which means lips fillers. Also, though she already had big cheekbones, they look bigger than before which also could mean cheek fillers. It really looks like she's got loads done on her face.</p><p>But works on her face she has never admitted. Chrissy Teigen once stated in an interview that she has had numerous plastic surgeries and that those procedures were performed mainly to modify her face with her cheeks left untouched.</p><p>She very boldly and surprisingly claimed that her forehead, lips, nose, and jaw were all fake. Her open revelation kind of shocked her fans. But little did people know that they were not to be shocked because it was not a revelation and it was meant to be taken as a joke.</p><p>When multiple tabloids and news websites picked up on Chrissy Teigen's plastic surgery revelations, bought her admission, and published it, in response to that, she tweeted that it had not been an admission of any sort but it was just her joking about having artificial facial pieces.</p><p>Having joked about and denied plastic surgery, Chrissy Teigen seemed like every other people who never admits to going under the knife. She admitted to liposuction procedures when she told <a href=# rel=noopener>Allure</a> that she had her armpit sucked out.</p><p>She said that it was one of the best things she had ever done. It added two inches to her arms and made her feel better in strapless dresses, which made her feel more confident about her body. Apparently, it was a big secret but she didn't care anymore.</p><p>That time the model made this confession about liposuction, she also denied doing anything on her face. (Was that strategically done? Admit to just the one procedure while denying the others so people believe you.)</p><p>She mentioned that her face was real. Especially her cheeks. Aware of how a lot of people think she has 'those fake-ass cheeks', she took care to make it known that everything else was fake, but her cheeks are real. She very conveniently said that she was very open with other shit but her face is natural.</p><p>In&nbsp; June 2020, Chrissy Teigen opened up about having <a href=# rel=noopener>breast implants</a> just as she revealed that she had them removed. (Are we in square one then?) She told that she had her boobs done when she was about 20 years old. She did it more for a swimsuit thing. Her thinking was somewhere along the lines of if she was going to be posing, laid on her back, she wanted her boobs to be perky.</p><p>She had talked about having her breast implants removed previously in May 2020. She eulogized that implants had been great to her for many years but she was just over it, so she was getting her boobs out.</p><p>Chrissy Teigen said that she would like to be able to zip a dress in her size, and lay on her belly with pure comfort.</p><p><strong>Visit <a href=#>House & Whips</a> for more <a href=#>interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGiaoaqZqMC6edOeoKCdnmKvprLOq5xmqJyWwLW1wmaqrqqXmr%2B6ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
