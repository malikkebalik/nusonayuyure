He has written over 280 songs, the best known being “You Never Even Called Me By My Name” (1975), “Longhaired Redneck” (1976), “ The Ride” (1982), “She Used to Love Me a Lot” (1984), “Mona Lisa Lost Her Smile” (1984) among others.

It has been estimated by authoritative sources that the overall size of his wealth is as much as $10 million, as of the data given in the middle of 2016. Music is the main source of David Allan’s net worth.</p><h3>David Allan Coe Net Worth $10 Million</h3><p>To begin with, he was raised in Akron, but at the age of nine he was sent to reform school, and subsequently spent most of his youth in Ohio State Penitentiary and similar institutions, so his image as an ‘outlaw’ is not just a show, unlike other country and rock musicians. His idols were Hank Williams, and Screamin’ Jay Hawkins – a fellow inmate. In 1968, his first album entitled “Penitentiary Blues” was released while he was serving a prison sentence, starting-off his net worth.</p><p>In 1970, Coe toured with Grand Funk Railroad – his concerts were wild and unpredictable, for example appearing on stage riding a motorcycle, wearing a typical country rhinestone costume and a mask. At that time, he called himself Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy, and this image occurs in some of his albums like “The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy” (1974) which are only for adults. The songs are about sex and racism which he represents directly and subjectively. The most famous song is “Nigger Fucker”, a song that is full of racist stereotypes. Coe himself says that one should not take it all so seriously. In David Allan Coe’s concerts different marginalized groups like bikers, cowboys and hippies unite.</p><p>David Allan has released 42 studio albums, and one the most successful was “Matter of Life … and Death” (1987). For some time he worked with Steve Popovich, and they have their own record label COEPOP Records in which albums like “Songwriter of the Tear or Biketoberfest ’01” were released. His latest album “D.A.C.’s Back” was released in 2010, containing compilations of his songs which he wrote in 1990s. Overall, all the songs, albums, concerts as well as collaborations with other artists have increased the total size of David Allan Coe net worth.</p><p>Coe has experienced great success, just not as a singer but as a songwriter, and in this sphere he showed his soulful side. He has written songs for <a href=#>Tanya Tucker</a>, Billie Jo Spears, <a href=#>George Jones</a> and many more. One of his greatest successes was “Take This Job and Shove It” for Johnny Paycheck, which later spawned a film in which they both had minor parts. Another popular song was “You Never Even Called Me By My Name”.</p><p>Finally, in the personal life of the singer and songwriter, David Allan Coe has married six times, the last to Kimberley in 2010 with whom he has lived and performed since 2000; he has five children.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=20.388563049853><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>David Allan Coe</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 6, 1939</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Akron, Ohio, U.S.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Songwriter, outlaw country music singer, guitarist</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Starr Commonwealth For Boys reform school, Ohio State Penitentiary</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Children</td><td>Shelli Coe, Tyler Mahan Coe, Carla Coe, Tanya Montana Coe, Shyanne Coe, You Never Even Called Me by My Name, If That Ain't Country, Would You Lay With Me</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Donald Mahan Coe</td></tr><tr readability=0.38095238095238><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/DACoutlaw</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/davidallancoecd</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm0019892</a></td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Record Labels</td><td>Plantation Records, COEPOP Records, ‎Columbia‎, D.A.C.</td></tr><tr readability=13><td>Albums</td><td>"Penitentiary Blues" (1968), “The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy” (1974), “Matter of Life ... and Death” (1987), “Songwriter of the Tear or Biketoberfest '01”, “D.A.C.'s Back” (2010), "Live in Branson, MO, USA", "Nothing Sacred", "Underground Album"</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nominations</td><td>Country Music Association Award for Song of the Year</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Movies</td><td>"Heartworn Highways" (1975)</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>"Grand Funk Railroad"</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Soundtrack <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=soundtrack readability=26.5><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>The Last Man on Earth</td><td></td><td>TV Series performer -
