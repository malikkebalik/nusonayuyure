He then joined the Conservative Research Department and became special adviser, first to Norman Lamont and then to Michael Howard. He was Director of Corporate Affairs at Carlton Communications for seven years. Cameron first stood for Parliament in Stafford in 1997. He ran on a Eurosceptic platform, breaking with his party's then-policy by opposing British membership of the single European currency, and was defeated by a swing close to the national average. He was first elected to Parliament in the 2001 general election for the Oxfordshire constituency of Witney. He was promoted to the Opposition front bench two years later and rose rapidly to become head of policy co-ordination during the 2005 general election campaign. With a public image of a youthful, moderate candidate who would appeal to young voters, he won the Conservative leadership election in 2005.Following the election of a hung parliament in the 2010 general election, Cameron became Prime Minister as the leader of a coalition between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. The 43-year-old Cameron became the youngest Prime Minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812, beating the record previously set by Tony Blair in May 1997. He was re-elected as Prime Minister in the 2015 general election with the Conservatives winning a surprise parliamentary majority for the first time since 1992, despite consistent predictions of a second hung parliament. He is the first Prime Minister to be re-elected immediately after serving a full term with an increased popular vote share since Lord Salisbury in 1900 and the only Prime Minister other than Margaret Thatcher to be re-elected immediately after a full term with a greater share of the seats.Cameron's premiership has been marked by the ongoing effects of the late-2000s financial crisis leading to a large deficit in government finances, which his government has emphasised the need to reduce through austerity measures. His administration introduced large-scale changes to welfare, immigration policy, education and healthcare, by introducing the Welfare Reform Act of 2012, the Education Act of 2011, the Health and Social Care Act of 2012 and a range of immigration reforms from 2010 onwards, culminating in the Immigration Act of 2014. In 2011, Cameron became the first British Prime Minister to 'veto' an EU treaty. His government introduced a nationwide referendum on voting reform in 2011 and a Falkland Islands sovereignty referendum in 2013, agreed to a Scottish independence referendum in September 2014, legalised same-sex marriages in England and Wales, and met the United Nations target of spending at least 0 ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=21.63689892051><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>David Cameron</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1.2 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>1966-10-09</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Marylebone, London, United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.85&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Politician, Spokesperson, Editor</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Work Position</td><td>David Cameron navigational boxes</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Education</td><td>Eton College, University of Oxford, Brasenose College, Oxford, Heatherdown School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>British</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Samantha Cameron</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Children</td><td>Ivan Reginald Ian Cameron, Arthur Elwen Cameron, Nancy Gwen Cameron, Florence Rose Endellion Cameron</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Ian Donald Cameron, Mary Fleur Cameron</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Siblings</td><td>Allan Alexander Cameron, Tania Rachel Cameron, Clare Louise Cameron</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nicknames</td><td>David Cameron, Cameron, David</td></tr><tr readability=0.30769230769231><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/DavidCameronOfficial</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.32558139534884><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/david_cameron</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.32558139534884><td>Google+</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://plus.google.com/+DavidCameron</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.3265306122449><td>LinkedIn</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.linkedin.com/in/davidcameronmp</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.23529411764706><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://imdb.com/name/nm5083702</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>NME Award for Villain of the Year</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nominations</td><td>Shorty Award for Government</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Movies</td><td>Mad Max, My First Wife, The Legend Maker, Dogwoman: A Grrrl's Best Friend, Chainsaw</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Make Me a Tory</td></tr></table><p><a href=# class="shortc-button medium green"><span class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden=true></span> All pictures</a></p><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Steel</td><td>2015</td><td>completed</td><td>Alexander</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nightwing: The Darkest Knight</td><td>2015</td><td>Short post-production</td><td>Talon / Calvin Rose</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow Hill</td><td></td><td>pre-production</td><td>Byron Unger</td></tr><tr><td>FanDeath Presents: Out</td><td>2014</td><td>Short</td><td>David</td></tr><tr><td>O Angel of God</td><td>2013</td><td>Short</td><td>Joseph</td></tr><tr><td>The Killing</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Teen Boy</td></tr><tr><td>Path to Shadow Hill</td><td>2013</td><td>Short</td><td>Byron Unger</td></tr><tr><td>Once Upon a Dark Park</td><td>2012</td><td>Short</td><td>Mitchell</td></tr></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqecrWWnpL%2B1tI6dmK%2BhlGKwornEq6anZZ6awW7DzquroWVhbnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
