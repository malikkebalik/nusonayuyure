Fans in the US watched the first episode on Hulu, fans in Asia watched the series on Ani One Asia, and fans in Europe and Latin America are still waiting for Disney Plus to release the episode.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure><p>Disney Plus has streaming rights for Bleach’s “Thousand Year Blood War” to international fans; however, only 5 countries (UK, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada) have received the first episode so far. It looks like Disney Plus won’t simulcast (release the episode same day as Japan’s premiere) Bleach’s final arc for most of the countries in Europe and Latin America.</p><p>Previously, Disney Plus also gained exclusive streaming rights for Summer Time Rendering anime, whose episodes were delayed weeks and months from the official Japanese premiere. Many regions had a different release date for the Summer Time Rendering. It looks like Bleach’s final arc is heading to the same route, with each region or country having a different release date for the episodes.</p><p>Some fans from Latin America reached out to Disney Plus Help Twitter account to discuss this issue. Disney Plus responded that this time they have not included Bleach in the Latin American region. Dinsey Plus hasn’t responded to Bleach fans from Europe so far.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thetalkstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1665457119_952_Disney-Plus-Wont-Simulcast-Bleach-TYBW-In-Latin-America-And.jpg><p>The first episode of the Bleach TYBW arc was leaked/released 1-day early (even before the official Japanese premiere) and made its way to several illegal streaming sites. If Bleach’s situation for Europe and Latin America remains the same, fans will be forced to use not-so-legal means to watch the new episodes.</p><h2>Why is Disney+ Is Delaying The Episodes?</h2><p>According to some fans’ speculation, Disney is behind schedule on subbing the episodes in different languages, which might be why Bleach’s new episodes are delayed.</p><p>We got Bleach’s official streaming platform confirmation just a week before the official premiere. Disney might have been sorting things out with Crunchyroll about removing Bleach’s previous episodes from Crunchyroll and finalizing the deal. Hopefully, fans will get some official confirmation from Disney Plus, clearing doubts about the current situation.</p><p>Fans want to support the creators of the series by watching the series officially, but if the situation persists, there is no other way than to turn to not-so-official sources.
