However, Vicente clarifies that his intention is not to replace conventional airplane seating but to provide an alternative that could potentially enhance comfort for certain passengers. Having experienced the discomfort of limited leg room during flights, he designed the Chaise Longue to address this issue. While the increased cabin capacity may appeal to airlines, it is not the primary focus of Vicente's concept.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d41b8zmzw515u.cloudfront.net/6a5ac806-0064-45a8-a81d-bbd5623c2529.jpg><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Investor Confidence Triggered Surge in Netflix Stock Prices Even as Streaming Industry Struggled</a></p><h2 class=split>&nbsp;</h2><h2 class=split>The Latest Chaise Longue Prototype</h2><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>How Third Party Power Suppliers Allegedly Deceive People Into Paying More for Electricity</a></p><p>Th initial impressions of the newest Chaise Longue prototype were positive. The design incorporates four rows, with two on the upper level and two on the lower level, featuring reclining seats and enhanced legroom. Passengers can enjoy inflight entertainment on personal devices, and there is ample space to stretch out and recline. However, opinions regarding the lower level seating varied, with some finding it claustrophobic while others appreciated the additional legroom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d41b8zmzw515u.cloudfront.net/dc8d40bd-0f85-4d8e-a056-a6ada1857af9.jpg><h2 class=split>Feedback to the Prototype&nbsp;</h2><p>Núñez Vicente actively seeks feedback from industry professionals and travelers. The latest version of the Chaise Longue was exhibited at the Aircraft Interiors Expo, where it underwent testing by airline representatives and members of the public.&nbsp;</p><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Potential Adaptation to Other Cabin Classes</h2><p>Although the focus has been on economy class, Vicente envisions the double-decker structure being adaptable to other cabin classes as well. He has released renderings of a premium economy version of the Chaise Longue, which maintains the same concept while eliminating the lower middle seat. By optimizing space utilization, Vicente believes the double-decker design can be applied to any cabin class, revolutionizing air travel and providing enhanced comfort for passengers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d41b8zmzw515u.cloudfront.net/144f2659-41fd-4f89-a46a-daf544f98cbb.jpg><h2 class=split>Challenges and Certifications&nbsp;</h2><p>The Chaise Longue comes with its own set of challenges. Vicente acknowledges that the certification process will be lengthy and complex, requiring extensive testing and approval from regulatory authorities. Additionally, the airline industry's focus on investing in business and first class rather than economy class presents <a href=#>another obstacle</a>. Nevertheless, Núñez Vicente remains determined to overcome these challenges, confident that his concept will eventually become a reality.</p><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>However, he believes in the feasibility of the double-decker airplane seat. He is convinced that passengers will appreciate the comfort and benefits it offers once they experience it firsthand. For Núñez Vicente, this project is not just about the seat itself; it is a personal journey that enriches his life and allows him to explore new horizons.</p><p style=color:#000><span></span></p><p><a style="border-bottom:2px solid #05090b" href=#>Here's the Firm That Fired 400 People on Call After Telling Them to Work Remotely for a Day</a></p><p><a style="border-bottom:2px solid #05090b" href=#>All About YouTube's New Feature That Allows Creators to Share Exclusive Shorts With Paid Viewers</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae4psDRnpiloaOpe6S7zGiamqZdmby2rsueZJ2dk6Cys3nAoqmppJGjsm6%2BxK%2Bmpa2knryvtdmeZJ%2BkqZ67qHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
