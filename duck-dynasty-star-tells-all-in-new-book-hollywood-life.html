They also discuss their wild pasts. Alan was drinking and doing drugs by the time he was 15, and as a teen, Lisa was molested on and off for seven years. She also had an abortion at 17, but that’s something she now regrets.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Alan and Lisa dated in high school, but they took a break when his behavior nearly ruined them. They reconnected a year later, according to the magazine, but when Lisa had an affair with an old boyfriend in 1999, things almost ended for good.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>And apparently, the Robertsons weren’t too pleased with Lisa’s behavior.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“It was really hard. It was one of the most difficult things our family has ever gone through…What I will say is that once I made the decision that I was in a place where I could forgive Lisa and I wanted our marriage to work, they got on board behind me. It took a little while for each of them in their individual way to work through their issues with Lisa, but they did. And now we’re very close and they’re very close to her,” Alan told Us Weekly.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>As far as her abortion is concerned, Lisa felt it was necessary to tell that&nbsp;story as well.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“I thought it was important to [talk about the abortion]&nbsp;because there are people out there who this has happened to…I had one girl tell me she has cried herself to sleep just about every night for the last 25 years after having an abortion, and nobody else knows about it. She regretted it all this time, but she just can’t seem to find a place of healing from it. So I thought it was a very unique thing for somebody who is in our position to say, “Look, I did this. And you can find healing and comfort from Jesus in it,” Lisa told the magazine.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>We think it’s great that Alan and Lisa are being so open about their past experiences. We hope others can learn from it and possibly find some sort of comfort.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>What do YOU think, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>?
