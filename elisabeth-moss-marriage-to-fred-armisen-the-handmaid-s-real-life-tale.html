The Atlantic reported that <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2012/03/elisabeth-moss-hated-fred-armisens-wit-dennis-quaid-accused-date-poaching/330801/>the actress said</a> to Page Six in 2012:</p><p class=dh>"One of the greatest things I heard someone say about him is, 'He's so great at doing impersonations.

Armisen also explained that when it comes to relationships, he usually jumps into them too quickly and gets emotionally freaked out by them just as fast.</p><p class=dh>He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/20210708117093/elisabeth-moss-traumatic-past-marriage-the-handmaids-tale-fred-armisen/>said</a>, "I think I was a terrible husband.

And sometimes you just want to be a bad girl for a minute."</p><p class=dh>She told People in 2012 that she enjoyed being single and loved how fun it was to have night outs without knowing how they would turn out. The 40-year-old further mentioned at the time that she was having a lot of fun and was obsessed with her freedom.</p><p class=dh>Her first marriage not working out didn't put her off relationships for good, though. Plus, her excitement that she was a single lady didn't stop her from saying she still wanted to have someone special in her life.</p><p class=dh>The star described the kind of partner she wants, and meeting someone that makes her laugh appeared to be at the top of her list. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/celebrity/mad-mens-elisabeth-moss-disses-her-ex-husband-fred-armisen/>expressed</a>:</p><p class=dh>"A guy that can make you laugh is everything."</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Elisabeth Moss</a> also revealed her feelings about starting a family and stated that she wasn't sure if she wanted to have kids.
