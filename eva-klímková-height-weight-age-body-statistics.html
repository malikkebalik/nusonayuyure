Eva had loved every second of it but had been scared too at the same time and had found it to be a handicap to have not been fluent in English at the time. She had enjoyed meeting a huge number of people and had ended up making great friends.</li><li>Eva has disclosed that doing fashion weeks as a model in London, Paris, and Milan, have felt great but that it has also been extremely stressful. She has gone on to state that one of her best experiences of working in fashion week has been the <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Jean-Paul Gaultier</a> show that she did in Paris. She had thoroughly enjoyed herself as it was a very different show during which she even got to dance. Eva also loved doing a campaign for Burberry for Mother’s Day and has, in general, had a wonderful time doing shootings as she has got the opportunity to do exciting things and has been able to travel, having loved going to new places.</li><li>Eva has a horse and she has done a lot of horse riding in the past. Her pet has been in the Czech Republic and she has missed him when she has gone away but every time she has been back at home, she has visited him. Before she began modeling, she had taken part in some jumping competitions with him.</li><li>Eva has revealed that she has eaten everything but has tried to follow the 5&nbsp;A Day campaign and consume her five in a day. She has taken care to eat healthily, to do sports along with doing a detox at times.</li><li>Eva has stated that she admires women who are happy. Her mother has been her heroine as she has always been able to conjure a smile to her face. She is the angel in her life having believed in Eva and always having declared her to be the most beautiful. She has added that her sister has also inspired her, with her beauty and confidence.</li><p>Featured Image by Replicant / Listal</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jp6tmmWbobaut86vmGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
