The couple, who were first spotted together in the summer of 2017, traveled the world together constantly as Hassan’s demanding billionaire business continued to soar. Still, Rihanna seemed to rarely stray from her man’s side and it sounds like things haven’t been easy on either of them since their split earlier this month, despite her recently being spotted with Drake. “The split is not something either of them really wanted, however, their relationship was becoming challenging,” our source added.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>With her Fenty lines that include make-up, lingerie and apparel, Rihanna has a certain image to keep up at all times. She’s constantly releasing new campaign images, videos and more and she’s got a lot of product to sell! It wouldn’t be easy for her to change her look or ways in her line of work for anyone, including a man or his family, and she has no plans to do so.&nbsp; “Rihanna can’t because of her career which requires a certain image,” our source said. “Rihanna will always be true to herself.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH1ye5FsZqugmZa7r62MoZisq5GjequtzJ6cpWWWlrqquNhmp6udo6jCs7GMrKeloaRir7OxwKSsqWWimq60u81o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
