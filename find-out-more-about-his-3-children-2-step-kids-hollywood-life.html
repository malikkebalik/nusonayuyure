The 82-year-old drummer has gone on to record 20 solo albums, with his most recent being What’s My Name&nbsp;in 2019. He married his first wife, <strong>Maureen Cox, </strong>in 1962, and the pair were married until 1975. The pair had three children.

First, on Oct. 3 he took to Instagram to postpone his tour and inform the fans of his illness. “A message to Ringo’s fans:&nbsp; It has been confirmed today that Ringo has Covid and his current All Starr tour will be on hold while he recuperates,” he captioned <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the photo</a> of him in an airplane. Then, one week later, he thought all was good to go and announced he was healthy again. “On the road again I will see you in Seattle on Tuesday the 11th Portland Wednesday I am negative peace and love everybody thanks for waiting. Ringo,” the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Oct. 10 caption</a> read. But sadly, Ringo had come down with the terrible illness again <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>on Oct. 13</a>. “I’m sure you’ll be as surprised as I was I tested positive again for Covid the rest of the tour is off I send you peace and love Ringo,” the 82-year-old wrote. Aside from his recent health issues, the British rock n’ roll icon continues to be a proud dad and spend time with his family.
