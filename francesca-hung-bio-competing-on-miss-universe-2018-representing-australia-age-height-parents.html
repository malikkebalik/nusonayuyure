The Northern Sydney native works a full-time model for Westfield and Slate Swimwear. However, the road to modeling industry wasn’t easy for her. Speaking with News.com.Au, she said:</p><p>&nbsp;‘I always wanted to get into modelling and media, but I really struggled to break in to an agency. Eventually someone [Scoop Management] snatched me up.’</p><p>Fulfilling her dreams, Hung eventually became Miss Universe Australia 2018. At present, she is giving her best to bring Miss Universe crown home. Previously, she had gone through a battle against depression. She as a person hated herself and thought so worthless. Due to her half Chinese ethnicity, she partly stopped from being sensible of her inner voice.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bk6LGnyl7hE/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_medium=loading</p><p>Sooner or later, Hung sought the help of a&nbsp;psychologist and took anti-depressant medication. Then, she weaned her fears off and worked on her health and fitness that immensely helped her to cope up as anti-depression pills. The brunette is stricter with her exercise and diet for the Miss Universe competition. She said to&nbsp;<a href=#>PopSugar</a>:</p><p>‘I always tell myself that it won’t always be like this, but I need to put in the hard yards now so I can feel my best when I am competing in the competition.’</p><p>When the media asked her about the pressure of having a particular way to look for the pageant, Hung did not deny there was a preferred look.</p><p>‘Of course with the Miss Universe Pageant, they want to see fit and healthy girls take the stage, so I am conscious of working out and eating extremely well before I head to Thailand for the final.’</p><p>Read more:&nbsp;<a href=#>Shrinkhala Khatiwada Bio: Journey To Top 12 On Miss World 2018 | Boyfriend And Family Details</a></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Francesca_Hung_Boyfriend_and_Affairs></span>Francesca Hung Boyfriend and Affairs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There aren’t any doubts about the beauty and elegance that Francesca Hung possesses.
