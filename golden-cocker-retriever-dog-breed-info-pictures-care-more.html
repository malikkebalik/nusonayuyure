So fuzzy and cuddly that you just want to squeeze them, this is a playful breed. Since they are a designer breed that is pretty much new, there isn’t much information to be found on them. However, they did get all the best traits from their loving Cocker Spaniel and Golden Retriever parents.</p><p>Like most puppies, this breed is going to be curious, active, and into everything so they can learn everything about the environment they live in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2><span id=Temperament_Intelligence_of_the_Golden_Cocker_Retriever>Temperament & Intelligence of the Golden Cocker Retriever</span></h2><p>Now that we’ve given you the costs of purchasing and taking care of the Golden Cocker Retriever, as well as some little-known facts, it’s time to talk about other things to do with this <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>fuzzy breed of animal</a>.</p><p>This is an intelligent breed of dog and is alert yet docile at the same time. We’ve already stated that this is the perfect breed for beginning dog owners, as they are very family-oriented, eager to please, and friendly.</p><p>However, it’s important to realize this dog will want to be included in everything their family does, whether it’s surfing Netflix on the couch or an outside picnic while throwing the Frisbee. Therefore, it’s best to bring this puppy into a home with a large family that has plenty of time to spend with him, as he will suffer from separation anxiety if left alone for a very long a time.</p><h3><span id=Are_These_Dogs_Good_for_Families>Are These Dogs Good for Families? 👪</span></h3><p>As previously stated, this dog breed is the perfect pet for a large, boisterous, active family. They are great with children and will have no problem getting out in the front yard getting dirty with the best of the lot. Because they are so sweet and loving, this dog is more patient being with smaller children than most dog breeds are.</p><p>While this dog can be a companion to one person, it’s best to work out of your home or take the dog with you wherever you go, as they do have a needy streak and want to be around their people constantly.</p><h3><span id=Does_This_Breed_Get_Along_with_Other_Pets>Does This Breed Get Along with Other Pets?</span></h3><p>This breed of dog is social and can co-exist peacefully with other types of animals in a home. They do, however, have a hunting streak from their ancestors, and while that drive isn’t very high, they could chase smaller animals. While this breed is in no way aggressive, they will be very protective of their family, so if they feel you’re in danger from an angry person or an aggressive animal, their instinct will be to protect.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></p><h2><span id=Things_to_Know_When_Owning_a_Golden_Cocker_Retriever>Things to Know When Owning a Golden Cocker Retriever:</span></h2><p>So, you now know quite a bit about the Golden Cocker Retriever, you’re probably ready to go out and adopt or purchase one for your family.
