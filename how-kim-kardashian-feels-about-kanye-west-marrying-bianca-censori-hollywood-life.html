Kim has known Bianca for several years, as Bianca started working with Kanye while he was<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> still married to Kim</a>,” the source continued. “The kids may have met her while she was working with Kanye, as she was at several work-related events that Kim was also at.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-spl-embed_11.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>It was revealed last week that Kanye, 45, married the Australian designer, 27, in a private ceremony before <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>honeymooning with her in Utah</a> at the five-star Amangiri resort. He was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photographed wearing a gold band</a> on his left ring finger as he arrived at the posh getaway and then once again while enjoying lunch with his lover at the Waldorf Astoria in Beverly Hills on Monday, Jan. 9.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>HollywoodLife</strong> has not received a response from Kanye’s representative to confirm or deny the reports of the surprising union. However, the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>father of four</a> hinted at a romance with Bianca in his new song, “Censori Overload”. The lyrics of the song address a past failed relationship before hinting at his next — and possibly current — one. “Wakin’ up to ‘I can’t do this anymore’ texts … And the Bible said I can’t have any more sex till marriage,” he raps.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/kanye-west-married-Bianca-Censori-embed_11.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>As fans know, Kim and Kanye <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>finalized their divorce</a>&nbsp;in Nov. 2022 after&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announcing their split</a> in early 2021. According to the final settlement obtained by&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife</strong>, Kim and Kanye will get<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> joint custody with “equal access”</a> to their 4 children — <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>North</strong></a>, 9,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Saint</strong></a>, 7,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Chicago</strong></a>, 4, and&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Psalm</strong></a>, 3 — and&nbsp;Kanye will pay Kim $200,000 a month in child support.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>The “Bound 2” hitmaker has been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>linked to several women</a> following his and Kim’s divorce: model <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Irina Shayk</a></strong>, actress&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Julia Fox</strong></a>, and model<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;<strong>Chaney Jones</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>And although he seemingly had no problem jumping back into the dating game, Kanye did have a problem with the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>9-month relationship</a> Kim enjoyed with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Pete Davidson</strong></a> between 2021 and 2022. He made it very clear that he did not appreciate <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“Skete”</a>, as he nicknamed him, being around his children. “For Pete and the kids to get so close, so fast, is deeply unsettling for Kanye,” a<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> source EXCLUSIVELY revealed to <strong>HollywoodLife</strong></a> in June of last year. “It’s really difficult seeing photos of them together everywhere he goes, and he just wishes things were different.” Things are certainly different now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ye5BwZqGnp2K4qrmMpJirnJGotaqtzWadnp2cqHqsrc2ynGavlajBbrnAq6myoZ6ceqO1wKeammWTmru0u9GiZJ6wk6HCtLXVnmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
