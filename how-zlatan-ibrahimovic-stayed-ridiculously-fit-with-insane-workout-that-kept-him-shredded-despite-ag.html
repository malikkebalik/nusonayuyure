Not only did he step away from top level football for a stint in America's MLS in 2018, but upon returning to Europe a year later, he guided AC Milan to a first Serie A win in 11 years in 2022.
He did that, as he put it, without an anterior cruciate ligament, needing his knee drained once a week along with reduced training sessions, but the Swede still delivered on the pitch."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Well outside of viral videos of his extreme workouts, Ibrahimovic took time to detail his incredible fitness regime earlier this year.</p><p><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Telling GQ</a> that he’s ‘always on the move’ the former Manchester United star explained: “I take it to extreme levels: I have a thing where I’m never satisfied.&nbsp;</p><p>“I always try to push up the level each time. That’s the key to getting movement into all areas of your life – next time, take the stairs.”</p><p>That movement has been restricted in the past, with Zlatan turning to yoga.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p>“The toughest time for me was when I was seriously injured and I couldn’t move in the way that I was used to,” he said. “That’s when I discovered yoga.</p><p>“I’m used to more body contact, moving fast. Yoga was the opposite, so it was a new challenge for me, and I found it really positive. I had to teach myself to cool down, move slowly and differently, focus…&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/02/Zlatan-Ibrahimovic-3.jpg><p>“It was very exciting: I learned skills and practices that I can now apply on the football pitch. You should never be afraid to try different things.”</p><p>He continued: “I’m very competitive, so the more extreme and the more challenging, the better. I never turn down a challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>“My continued desire to play comes from that inability to ever give up, teamed with a desire to be a role model to the younger players on my team and kids in general.&nbsp;</p><p>“Where I come from, people were always judging me and telling me, ‘No, that’s not possible’. I want to show kids growing up like I did that anything’s possible. I’m the living proof that you can succeed.”</p><p>Diet is also important to Ibrahimovic, who let fans in on his simple but effective food intake.</p><p>“I’ve always taken care of my body, and what I eat has definitely helped me stay at the top level,” he said. “Food that works for me is pasta, meat, fish and a lot of eggs.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/12/crop-1286433.jpg><p>“Getting sleep is important too, but I’m also here to remind people that you don’t need the perfect conditions to succeed.&nbsp;</p><p>“If we look all over the world, not everybody has access to the ideal food or training gear or pitches. I know I didn’t, and look at me now!”</p><p>He concluded: “I love to try out new things, to challenge myself as much as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>“As a kid I did many different sports at school – that’s very common in Sweden. Ball, racket, track, or field: I was in. I think I was meant to end up as an athlete.&nbsp;</p><p>“I've also had a lot of fun acting, and presenting at the San Remo festival in Italy was such an experience, but my number one will always be football.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’ve reached a certain point where I’d like to give back. If I can motivate people to move, I’m willing to do more than 100 per cent because it’s all about giving back.”</p><p>When he signed off from football, there were rare tears, but the usual Ibrahimovic bravado.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on talkSPORT">Read More on talkSPORT</h2><p>"I saw it was raining and said: Even God is sad today," adding: "People think Ibra is Superman. Well, I am Superman, but I also have a big heart.</p><p>"I was looking around, trying to find a face that would give me strength, but everyone was crying! I looked at the players, they were crying. The fans were crying. I looked to my wife, I thought she’ll give me the strength to keep it together, but then she was crying more than anyone.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaG4tLzOq6tnm5%2BifKe7zq2ZmqScZH51gJRxbHBnqqGuta3NZqCbqpGdtq671aKaZp6Zqbumv9Jmrqiqm6TCtXnAoJxo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
