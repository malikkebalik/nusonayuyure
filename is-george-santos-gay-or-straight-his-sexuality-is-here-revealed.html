His campaign’s website said as recently as October that she had lived through the attack but died a few years later.</p><p style=color:#252525>With his victory in November, Mr. Santos became the first openly gay Republican to win a seat in the House of Representatives as a non-incumbent.

The divorce, which Santos hasn’t talked about in public, makes his political and biographical claims even less sure.</p><p style=color:#252525>“I am openly gay and have never had a problem with my sexual identity in the last ten years,” Santos told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">USA Today</a> in October in response to criticism about his support for Florida’s “don’t say gay” law, which was signed into law this year by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.</p><p>It’s possible that Santos, who says he has “never experienced discrimination in the Republican Party,” has been living comfortably as an openly gay man for more than a decade. He says he hasn’t had any problems because of his sexuality.</p><p>There are a lot of reasons why people get married. But Santos’ situation is strange because he never told voters about his divorce and never explained how his previous marriage to a woman, which ended just 12 days before he started his first campaign for Congress, fits with his claims that he is an openly gay Republican.</p><p style=color:#252525>It’s not clear why Santos hasn’t talked about his marriage and divorce, but it doesn’t make sense with what we know about him now.</p><p style=color:#252525>He has told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">U.S.</a> and<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Brazilian</a> media in the past that he was engaged to a man, a fellow Brazilian whom Santos has said is a pharmacist, and that he lives with his husband on Long Island. (The Daily Beast was unable to find any public record of the man’s work in that field or his marriage.)</p><p><strong>Read More</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Who Is Meadow Rain Walker?
