During his time as the prime-time anchor, he garnered the highest viewership ratings for the channel and many suspect that his departure will take a bigger toll on the network than himself. Moreover, now that the journalist has been ousted, a San Diego-based media outlet might be willing to pay $25 million for him to join their company.&nbsp;</p><p>One America News Network CEO and founder Robert Herring sent an email to the Times of San Diego, hinting at their whopping salary for Tucker to join them. “It would be great if we could get Tucker! I might give him around $25 million. And he would be well worth that!” read the email as per the online outlet. The news network appears to be very interested in bagging Tucker as the official Twitter account of OAN tweeted, "Fox News’ loss could be [OAN’s] gain," and added that "@RobHerring would like to extend an invitation to Carlson to meet for negotiation," on Monday, April 24.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Internet can't help itself as news of Tucker Carlson's shock firing from FOX brings smiles to Libs</a></p><p><a href=# rel>FOX RIVALS TUCKER UP: Tucker Carlson's firing fuels rumors about next move, as #boycottfox trends</a></p><h2 class=split>Can OAN afford the whopping salary?</h2><p>Among the striking claims, it is unclear if OAN can afford the huge numbers. Moreover, a former employee stated that the network has limited distribution due to losing its deal with DirecTV after liberal pressure which might prevent it from landing Carlson. It is also unclear if OAN is offering the payment annually or over the course of a longer deal. However, it goes without a doubt that Carlson, who was making around $8 million annually as the host of 'Tucker Carlson Tonight' on Fox News, will end up getting over three times more than what he was making if Herring offered a yearly salary, as per the Times of San Diego.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>OAN has a 'small reach'</h2><p>Eddie McCoven, a former broadcaster at OAN revealed to the outlet that he didn’t think the Carlson deal would be in the works “because with such a small reach now, what budget do they have for such a big name?” He continued, "It remains to be seen if OANN will survive the lawsuit it is facing from Dominion," adding, "Many colleagues tell me they can’t even keep basic newsroom positions staffed. OANN lacks the programming direction needed to support top-tier talk show talent." Thus, it would take a lot to restore OAN's reach.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>'I think that will kill Fox'</h2><p>Former Fox News host Glenn Beck spoke to Carlson on his radio show on Monday, shortly after the network announced that “Fox News Media and Tucker Carlson have agreed to part ways.” Addressing the TV journalist, Beck said, "We would love to have you here," before adding "You won’t miss a beat. And together, the two of us will tear it up. Just tear it up." "I think that will kill Fox, I really do,” Beck said. “I know so many people that – you know – still kind of like Fox. And they watch the other shows. But they’re like, ‘Tucker, Tucker is the only one that I really trust", added Beck.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRorKWYuKa%2BjJyYq6SjpLtuucign61ll5rBbn6UZqRmrJ9it7C1zWaqmqZdmbams85mmZqrlZl6sK3N</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
