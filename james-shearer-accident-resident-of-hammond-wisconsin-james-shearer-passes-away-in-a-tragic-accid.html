There was no mention of the accident’s specifics. During this trying time, our thoughts and prayers are with his friends, family, and community. James earned his UWBC degree. His employer was Leedstone.</p><p>Authorities said that a seven-vehicle crash that happened in western Wisconsin on Monday night resulted in the deaths of two persons and the injuries of six others. The Wisconsin State Patrol said that the crash happened at around 5:40 p.m. on westbound Interstate 94 close to Wilson.</p><p>Due to construction, there was a traffic jam on the route. According to the patrol, a semi driver struck a Ford F-150 and another semi after “failing to recognise the slowed traffic.” Four more automobiles were involved in the chain reaction, and multiple vehicles were set on fire.</p><p>The state patrol reported that both the driver of the semi-truck and the F-150 involved in the crash died. After receiving care, six injured individuals were later released from the hospital. The parties concerned have not disclosed their identities to the public. Both the highway and the Highway 128 flyover were briefly stopped at the location of the crash but have subsequently reopened.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigkarAorrEsGWcp51ju6h7yZqknqtdqLWmrdGeqWaZk5i2pbHNrWSrnaOesaa602amn2WYlrquu82dZLCho5i8r7%2FIp2SjmZ2awG6%2Fx56Yq52iYr2iv9KeqmaZp5bGbrXNZphmrKKWtKqvjJqanKGUmru1ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
