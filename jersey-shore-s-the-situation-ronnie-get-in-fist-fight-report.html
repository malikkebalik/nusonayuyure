It was a good ol’ Jersey fist fight — in Italy.
Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino and Ronnie Ortiz-Magro got into what’s being called a “major fist fight” last night during the show’s filming in Italy. Photos taken afterward show The Situation, who had the hood of a sweatshirt pulled over his head, with red marks on his face and Ronnie with what appeared to be fresh cuts on his knuckles."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Only real Italian pizza,” according to various Italian newspapers. Tamarri is Italian slang that can be roughly translated as yokel or uncultured idiot.</p><p>And officials banned the meatball-loving, booze-swilling cast from shooting at some of the most famous locations in the Renaissance city — including the renowned Uffizi gallery and the sculpture-filled Boboli Gardens.</p><p>Mayor Matteo Renzi also declared the stars must not be filmed in bars and clubs that serve alcohol and must not be filmed drinking in public. He also said he wants the show to promote Italy and feature its culture, traditions and good food.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2JlfnJ7j25ma2xfn7Kzv8SyZKygn6eytHnToZxmq5mpwqLAyKilZqqfo7uqsYygnK1lmaN6p7XSrWSfoZedwW6%2BxKmmq6xf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
