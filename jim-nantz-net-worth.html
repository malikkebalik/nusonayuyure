He is a journalist, mostly known as the voice of CBS Sports, and in particular for his telecasts of the NFL and the NCAA.</p><p>So just how rich is Jim Nantz? His net worth is estimated at $15 million, according to authoritative sources, which have also reported that the sportscaster has an annual salary of $7 million. He started making money after 1990, the highest part of his wealth coming from working with CBS Sports. Since 2009, Nantz has been engaged in a private wine label project, together with producer Peter Deutsch. Their collection, called “The Calling”, was launched in 2012, the first wine being named “The Masters”.</p><h3>Jim Nantz Net Worth $15 Million</h3><p>Jim Nantz went to Marlboro High School, New Jersey, where he played basketball and golf. After high school, he went to the University of Houston, where he also worked for CBS Radio Network, a modest start to his net worth. After graduating with a degree in radio and television in 1981, he started working as an anchor and a sportscaster for the local networks KHOU Houston and KSL-TV in Salt Lake City.</p><p>In 1985, he started his contract with CBS Sports. He began as a host for college football and basketball, while working also as a reporter for golf, then in 1989 he became the anchor for “The Masters”. In 1992 – the last time the Winter Games were held in the same year as the Summer Games – and 1994, he was the daytime co-host during the weekends for the Winter Olympics. Between 1998 and 2003, he hosted “The NFL Today” and, since 1994, he has also been CBS’ golf anchor. Jim Nantz is also a member of CBS’ lead commentary team for NFL coverage, being the NFL announcer on CBS’s top play-by-play team since 2004. From 2014, he also leads “Thursday Night Football”. All these activities have added significantly to Jim’s net worth.</p><p>Nantz is obviously famous for his extensive broadcasting of various sports. He has made telecasts of the National Football League (NFL), the Division I men’s basketball, the PGA Tour, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). His various works place him at the top of the list when it comes to the professionals in sports television, supporting his net worth.</p><p>He has won numerous awards for his professional activities, including two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Sports Personality, Play-by-Play. The National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association have five times named him the National Sportscaster of the Year. The sportscaster also holds a Basketball Hall of Fame’s Curt Gowdy award and the 2012 Ambassador Award of Excellence awarded by the LA Sports & Entertainment Commission.</p><p>Jim Nantz adds money to his net worth from television appearances in numerous series and shows, including “Clubhouse”, “Criminal Minds” and “How I Met Your Mother”. He also wrote and produced the television movie “Jim Nantz Remembers Augusta: The 1977 Masters”, released in 2010.</p><p>As a writer, Nantz published his first book in 2008: “Always By My Side – A Father’s Grace and a Sports Journey Unlike Any Other” is a collection of stories inspired from the world of sportsmen, with whom the journalist has always been familiar.</p><p>Outside his career in broadcasting, Jim Nantz has been involved in numerous projects for the community. After his father’s death in 2008, he launched the Nantz National Alzheimer center, in a common project with the Methodist Hospital in Houston. The center has the purpose of researching and developing treatments for Alzheimer’s disease, which caused his father’s death.</p><p>In his personal life, Jim Nantz has been married twice, to Ann-Lorraine Carlsen Nantz, between 1983 and 2009, and to Courtney Richards since 2012. The sportscaster has two daughters, one from each marriage. His first wife and their daughter receive over $900,000 a year in child support and alimony.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=19.289446185998><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Jim Nantz</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$15 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>May 17, 1959</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Charlotte, North Carolina, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft 3 in (1.91 m)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Sports commentator, Actor, Commentator</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Marlboro High School, University of Houston</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Spouse</td><td>Courtney Richards (m. 2012), Ann-Lorraine Carlsen Nantz (m. 1983–2009)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Caroline Nantz</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Doris Nantz, Jim Nantz Jr.</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Nancy Hockaday</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Nicknames</td><td>James William Nantz III , Wiiliam James Nantz III , William "Jim" Nantz, III , James William Nantz, III</td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0620966</a></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Awards</td><td>Sports Emmy Award for Outstanding Sports Personality - Play-By-Play, Sports Emmy Award for Outstanding New Approaches Sports Programming</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nominations</td><td>Sports Emmy Award for Outstanding Sports Personality - Studio Host, The George Wensel Technical Achievement Award</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Movies</td><td>March Madness: The Greatest Moments of the NCAA Tournament</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>TV Shows</td><td>Thursday Night Football, The NFL Today</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=24.107714701601><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Won the 2016 Golf Coaches Association of America Lifetime Achievement Award.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>2</td><td>Lives in Westport, Connecticut with his wife, Lorri, and daughter, Caroline.
