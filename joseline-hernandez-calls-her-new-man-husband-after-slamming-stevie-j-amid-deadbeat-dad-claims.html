She did not tag the man, who looked happy to be getting a kiss from Joseline, but simply <a class="Vc -G" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv9Xngbh-fG/>captioned</a> it: “He knows I love him.”</p><p class=Fg>That was enough to raise eyebrows and get the gossip mill running, but Joseline gave fans more to talk about after The Shade Room <a class="Vc -G" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv9ZB-LBbeP/>posted</a> the same video on their page and she showed up in the comment section with the word: “Husband.”</p><p class=gi data-testid=image-source>Screenshot of Joseline Hernandez calling the new man "Husband." | Photo: Instagram/The Shade Room</p><p><h3 class=Kg>THE PREVIOUS CONTROVERSIAL NEW MAN</h3></p><p class=Fg>Although the self-acclaimed Puerto Rican princess is yet to elaborate on her shocking comment, the timing would seem kind of awkward if she did tie the knot with this new man.</p><p class=Fg>Less than three months ago, Joseline was <a class="Vc -G" href=#>slammed</a> after showing off a new man on social media.
