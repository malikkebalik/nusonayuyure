The husband and wife dressed as the “wet bandits” from the 1990 film Home Alone and posed with hilarious facial expressions similar to the characters, in the epic selfie.

Justin’s face was full of red makeup to make it look like he was burnt with an iron, as Marv was in the movie, and Jessica had pieces of white feathers all over her face and hat, just like Harry had. “Harry, it’s our calling card! All the great ones leave their marks. We’re the wet bandits!,” the caption for the photo, which was posted to both Justin Jessica’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> accounts, read.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Once they shared the funny snapshot, it didn’t take long for their followers to comment. “So good!” many exclaimed while another called the costumes “the best.” Others left quotes from the characters in the movie and another wrote, “Amazing! I love that movie.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Justin-Timberlake-Jessica-Biel-halloween-2022-ss-post2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Before they wowed with their Halloween costumes, Justin and Jessica, who share <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sons<strong> Silas</strong>, 7, and<strong> Phineas</strong>, 2</a>, celebrated their 10-year wedding anniversary on Oct. 19. The lovebirds both took to social media to share several photos of the two of them together along with sweet captions to each other. “<span class="_aacl _aaco _aacu _aacx _aad7 _aade">Being married to you is the adventure of a lifetime! Run it back, baby. RUN IT BACK. I love you,” Jessica’s caption read while Justin wrote, “</span><span class="_aacl _aaco _aacu _aacx _aad7 _aade">10 years ain’t enough! You make me a better husband and father every day! I love you so much you beautiful human! Run it back!”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>When they’re not being cute online, Justin and Jessica are doing so at events. One of the most recent events they attended was the 2022 CHLA Gala in Santa Monica, CA. They looked as happy as could be as they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>posed on the red carpet</a> in stylish ensembles, including a long sleeveless black dress with silver lining and a lot of frills for Jessica, and a classic black and white tuxedo for Justin.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5JqZqOto6m2r3nToqSbnaKhrqyxjKOcrKuZmK5ursieo2agn6Kybq3LqKWeZaeawW6uwKeboqyjYrWiuMuorp6dnmKwsL%2FTrqSeZWJlf3N5z6GmraejZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
