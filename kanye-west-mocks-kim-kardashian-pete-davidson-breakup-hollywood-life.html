He was&nbsp;hurling insults at the&nbsp;<i>Saturday&nbsp;Night Live&nbsp;</i>alum both on both social media and in his song lyrics earlier this year. His threats got to the point where Kim expressed concern for Pete’s safety that Ye inevitably leaked to his Instagram. Come March, Ye reportedly&nbsp;told Kim that he’d be taking some time away and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“getting help</a>,” and after that he stopped his public attacks on Kim and Pete.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/kanye-celebrates-kim-and-petes-breakup-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>After news of Kim and Pete’s split broke on Friday, Aug. 5, speculation emerged that the SKIMS founder and Kanye <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>were back together</a>, especially since Ye was so forward in his&nbsp;attempts to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reconcile with Kim</a>. But a source close to Kim confirmed to&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>that the famous exes are “moving ahead with the divorce which will be finalized soon.” The insider added that Kim, who filed for divorce from Ye in Feb. 2021, “is not getting back with him.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Kim and Kanye will continue to co-parent their children&nbsp;<strong>North</strong>, 9, <strong>Saint,</strong>&nbsp;6,&nbsp;<strong>Chicago</strong>, 4, and<strong>&nbsp;Psalm,</strong> 3. Their co-parenting relationship was improving while Pete was away in Australia filming a new movie. “Kim and Kanye are <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>amicably co-parenting</a> now and it has everything to do with Pete being away in Australia,” the source told&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>EXCLUSIVELY late in July, prior to Kim and Pete’s breakup.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“Kanye is currently living at his house in Malibu and has been spending a ton of time with the kids,” the insider added. “He has been over to Kim’s house on multiple occasions for dinner with the kids and he feels comfortable coming over to her place because Pete is not there.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e49xZqSZnq6ybsPErKtmo5mieqyt0Z2YrKCZlrtuvMStnGackau2pb%2FOp2SbqpWWuLa8jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
