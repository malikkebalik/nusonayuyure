Another commented and seemingly agreed, writing, “<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">If [<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>International Women’s Day</a>] </span>means anything, surely it means that!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kate-Middleton-Meghan-Markle-mega-embed.jpg>The video, released on International Women’s Day, comes roughly one day after the March 7 CBS interview with Meghan and her husband&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Prince Harry</strong></a>. During Meghan’s conversation with Oprah, the Duchess of Sussex alleged that the two sisters-in-law had a disagreement <a href=#>that left Meghan in tears</a> just days before her wedding in May 2018. “No [I did not make Kate cry]… The reverse happened,” Meghan revealed, referencing tabloid stories that surfaced roughly six months after her nuptials claiming that she made Kate cry.<p id=content-paragraph-8></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kate-Middleton-Meghan-Markle-shutter-embed-2.jpg>“I don’t say that to be disparaging to anyone, because it was a really hard week of the wedding and she was upset about something, but she owned it and she apologized and she brought me flowers and a note apologizing, which is what I would do if I knew that I hurt someone… just take accountability for it,” Meghan said. The Duchess of Sussex reiterated the sentiment that,&nbsp;“If you love me, you don’t have to hate her. And if you love her, you don’t have to hate me.”<p id=content-paragraph-9>Following the interview, Kate was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spotted driving back to Kensington Palace</a> sporting a floral face mask and looking calm. Buckingham Palace has yet to comment on any of the claims that Meghan and Prince Harry made during the couple’s interview with Oprah. But Kate’s recent fashion choice will surely leave a few fans talking!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH10e49yZqSZpJp6rrXDnaOerJ%2Bjeq610qymppldmq6zvsinnqxlnZq0qa3NZqSaqpuhsm61za2cq66ZmsRw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
