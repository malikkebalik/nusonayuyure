The little boy was born a Taurus, making him a tolerant, warmhearted, and reliable friend and family member like others who fall under the star sign.</p><p class=dh>Shortly after Kenna's birth, the proud mom shared a lengthy message about her pregnancy and birth on Instagram, along with a photo of her on the hospital bed. Her sweet statement <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/COEG5zrn4VE/>read:</a></p><p class=dh>"Wow, What an adventure we’ve been on since the day he was conceived! I thank God everyday for blessing me with his super active energy (wonder where he gets it from?) and now to meet our healthy baby boy?! Thankful. Blessed."</p><p class=dh>When Kenna turned one, Milian made sure to shower him with love on social media by sharing a series of pictures and videos of her young son's smile.

"I'm so happy to be your Mom, my little clown. You have me wrapped around your finger forever," she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CcwXvqTppV2/>gushed</a>.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>THE PARENTS OF KENNA TOTA</strong></p><p class=dh>Although Kenna is only starting to understand the world around him, he will soon realize that he comes from a family of stars. Like his siblings, he will have to navigate life under the spotlight and maybe someday even follow in his famous parents' footsteps.</p><p class=dh>His dad, Matthieu Tota, best-known as Matt Pokora, is a French singer, actor, and producer. He is known for his <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1994189/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">work</a> on "Robin des Bois, la veritable histoire," "Asterix and the Vikings," and "M.

The restaurant's manager insisted the pair meet, as they were both musicians. The two of them hit it off and have stayed strong ever since.</p><p class=dh>In 2020, a French publication <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.public.fr/News/Exclu-Public-surprise-M-Pokora-s-est-marie-avec-Christina-Milian-tous-les-details-1661639>announced</a> that Milian and Pokora secretly tied the knot amidst them welcoming their first son Isaiah. It was a clandestine event attended by only their closest family and friends.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>THE SIBLINGS OF KENNA TOTA</strong></p><p class=dh>A year and three months before Kenna was born, his mom gave birth to his older brother, Isaiah, on January 20, 2020. Just a month before Isaiah turned one, Milian and Pokora announced they were expecting Kenna, which means Milian was taking care of her infant son while pregnant with another little one.</p><p class=dh>Before Isaiah and Kenna, Milian was already a proud mom to an adorable young girl named Violet Madison Nash. She gave birth to her on February 26, 2010, and shares her with her ex-husband, The-Dream.</p><p class=dh>Milian would gush about her eldest daughter, commending her for being the most thoughtful and caring big sister. The proud mom shared an adorable snap of Violet and Kenna gazing at each other, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/COUTm51H1Qz/>sharing:</a></p><p class=dh>"I feel like Kenna recognizes his big sister from all the time she spent talking to him in my belly. He’s literally so calm and just stares at her."</p><p class=dh>Milian and The-Dream began <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/15738998/christina-milian-kids-how-many/>dating</a> in February 2009 before getting hitched in a Las Vegas chapel just a little bit after six months. Unfortunately, they separated three months later, before the birth of their daughter.</p><p class=dh>It took Milian several tries at love before finally finding her happily-ever-after with Pokora. She dated rapper Lil Wayne and comedian Nick Cannon before meeting her now-husband.</p><p class=dh>Now, Millian couldn't be happier with how her life turned out. She is a doting mom to three beautiful children and a proud wife to a hardworking and talented man.</p><p class=dh>Every chance she gets, she makes sure to gush about her beautiful family on social media, showing fans that no matter how busy her career gets, she will always prioritize her family and put them first.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwa2llbHqssc2nmGasn6mubrXSZphmq5%2BjeqS00aKqraGelnqutcuimKdllpawb7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
