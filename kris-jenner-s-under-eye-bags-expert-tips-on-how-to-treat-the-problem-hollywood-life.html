There is a loss of volume under her eyes.&nbsp;If you look below the bags, you can see an indentation on the left eye, and the loss of volume in the cheeks makes the bags look worse.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>To treat dark circles and to tighten, we do something called <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Madonna Lift.</a> It’s a laser treatment and there is very little down time. It heals very quickly. You may be red and puffy for a day. It’s usually between $700 and $900 per treatment. You’ll need maybe two or three treatments depending on how deep the dark circles are and how deep the wrinkles are.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>To fill in the indentations, we use a filler. The newest FDA approved filler is called <strong>Voluma</strong> and it’s for indentations in the cheeks. You’ll only need one treatment of this. It lasts longer than other fillers, up to two years. Other fillers like<strong> Juvederm </strong>and<strong> Restylane</strong> usually last between nine and 12 months. Voluma is specifically for the mid-cheek area. It’s a little more expensive, $200 or $300 more, but it lasts much longer.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>In between treatments, use a light concealer to hide shadows and dark circles.”</p><h3>More Expert Opinions On Kris Jenner</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>Board Certified Facial Plastic Surgeon&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Dr. James C. Marotta</strong></a> talks about why under eye bags happen and how to fix them:</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“Unfortunately, genetics and aging play a major role when developing under eye bags, so many people will develop them despite good lifestyle choices. &nbsp;These bags represent small pockets of fat that develop around the lower eyelids. Also, the skin around the eyes is the thinnest, so it is the first to show aging and fatigue. Also, dehydration, stress, poor or high salt diet, and lack of sleep can make under eye bags look even worse.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><span>“Under eye bags can be fixed with a blepharoplasty or eyelid lift. Surgery, chemical peels and lasers can tighten the eyelid skin. Recovery time is about a week and prices range from $2,500-$5,000. For a non-surgical approach, I recommend fillers made of Hyaluronic acid such as Restylane, Juvéderm or<strong> Belotero</strong>. Tear-trough fillers remedy imperfections under the eyes, such as dark circles or hollowing and can smooth out the eyelids. The price tag ranges from $500 — 1,000 but the effect is temporary. There are numerous anti-aging creams and serums that are created to tighten the skin under the eyes, and reduce dark circles. They may have some minor beneficial effect, however, the best and most effective way to reduce under eye bags is with a procedure.”</span></p><h3>Why Under Eye Bags Appear In The First Place</h3><p id=content-paragraph-10><b><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Dr. Brian Glatt</a>,</b> board certified plastic surgeon in Morristown, NJ, tells <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> EXCLUSIVELY:</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“These occur as a consequence of aging. Over time, the “sling” holding them in becomes more loose, allowing the fat pockets to “poof” outwards. A lack of sleep, stress, smoking, and excessive sun exposure can all contribute to making them worse.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>“Surgery is THE mainstay of treatment for under eye bags and works incredibly well — these bags are typically corrected with one operation and very rarely does it ever need to be repeated — it is usually a “one and done” type of surgery. Cost of this surgery can run $2,000 — $5,000 depending on the area of the country. People feel well after a few days, however, it is usually one to two weeks until all of the typical aspects of recovery (bruising, swelling) are either completely gone or manageable with make-up. Although there are some excellent eye creams out there to help manage or prevent fine lines, there are no topical products which can prevent, control or adequately treat bags under the eyes.”</p><h3>The Best Treatments For Under Eye Bags</h3><p id=content-paragraph-13><b><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Dr. Yael&nbsp;Halaas</a>,</b>&nbsp;MD, FACS, Board Certified Cosmetic Surgeon, tells <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> it’s hard to avoid under eye bags but they can be treated a variety of ways:</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>“Although eating salty foods, lack of sleep and allergies can exacerbate puffiness of the lower lids, aging is usually the main culprit for the lower lids looking “baggy.” The surgical procedure to correct the lower lids is called Blepharoplasty, and it can be performed under local anesthesia and only takes about an hour in the OR. (The procedure ranges from $3,000 — $5,000). Fillers can be used in certain instances to camouflage lower lid bags ($850-$1750). Laser CO2 is also another go-to option to tighten skin and refresh the lower lids ($2,000). The recovery from surgery and CO2 takes about a week. Fillers have minimal downtime, if any.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Would you ever get cosmetic surgery to fix your under eye bags, <strong>HollywoodLifers?</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-16><strong>—&nbsp;Dory Larrabee</strong></p><h3>More Beauty News:</h3><li><a href=#>Kim Kardashian: Dark Circles Under Her Eyes — How To Cover Them Up</a></li><li><a href=#>Nina Dobrev Reveals How To Banish Under Eye Bags — Exclusive Interview</a></li><li>Lea Michele’s Skincare Secret — Under Eye Patches</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWljZH5ye5FrZqSqmah6q7HNp5yrZaWjsaa%2BjJ6wnmWSlrS0ecWamp6kmZvBbrHXqZyrrKNitaqwxGabmqqbYrCqvsKlnKxn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
