The couple had two kids.</p><p>A few years before their first child was born, the couple started out on their journey as a couple. In 1993, the couple just got married and moved to Toronto before the season began.</p><p>Most of the time Borje and Margitta were together, they were in Toronto, Canada. Borje, who used to be a defenseman in ice hockey, played there for 16 seasons, from 1973 to 1989.</p><p>In November 1974, they had their first child, a son named Anders Salming. Borje and his wife, Margitta, were obviously very happy when they had their first child. At the time, he was only 23.</p><p>Margitta got a job in the fashion industry while her future husband was making a name for himself in the National Hockey League after moving across the ocean to be with him. Margitta made a living as a designer of clothes for babies.</p><p>She also used what she knew about fashion design to get into interior design. The couple’s first home in Canada was an eight-story house in the Park Gardens neighborhood of Toronto, which Margitta designed.</p><p>When the couple bought a house in the mid-1970s, they decorated it in a way that showed their Scandinavian roots. Borje and his wife Margitta moved to Sweden after he stopped playing in the NHL. But not long after they got back to their home country in 1993, the couple decided to get divorced and break up.</p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;Rugby Presenter Elma Smit And Her Husband Richard Maspero Are Sports Journalists</strong></p><h2 id=borje-salming-and-second-wife-katarina-pettersson-salming-ended-on-good-terms>Borje Salming And Second Wife Katarina Pettersson Salming Parented Two Children</h2><p>Borje Salming had two children with his second wife, Katarina Pettersson Salming.</p><p>They broke up on good terms and still get along well.</p><p>Three times an NHL All-Star, Borje started dating Katarina after he and his first wife, Margitta, broke up.

The name of their daughter is Bianca, and the name of their son is Rasmus.</p><p>When it came out that Borje had Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) in 2021, his ex-wife Katarina, who was 58 at the time, was one of the first people to meet him in person.</p><p>Even though the couple’s relationship ended 15 years ago, they are still good friends. After hearing the news, Katarina and her daughter Bianca went to see Borje at his home.</p><p>“Then we broke up all three of them completely. We cried for a long time as we sat in the car. We did nothing else, and all you did was sit there and cry.” Katarina said. ‘</p><p>Their kids, Bianca and Rasmus, have spent a lot of time with Katarina and Borje in the house where they grew up in Vaxholm, just outside Stockholm.

But on the other hand, Rasmus may be the person who keeps his feelings to himself the most.</p><p>Borje Salming married Pia Salming in 2016 after two failed marriages. Pia, who was born on November 13, 1967, and NHL legend Borje Salming started dating about 17 years ago. After he broke up with Katarina, his second wife.</p><p>But Pia and Borje got married in 2016—six years ago. He is the stepfather of Sara and Lisa, who are both girls. They are Pia’s kids from a relationship she had before. After meeting on a trip across the land Sea, they got together and have been together ever since.</p><p>Pia, who is 55, is a tough woman who never gives up. She used to work as a hairdresser, just like her mother, but she switched careers and is now a police officer.</p><p>Even though she has wanted to be a cop since she was a child, Pia chose a different career path. Pia used to go to the hair salon that her mother owned when she was a child. She felt comfortable there, so she chose the same place as her mother.</p><p>Pia said, “I’ve always loved being a hairdresser, and I’ve never really wanted to quit.”</p><p>Pia went to high school at the age of 46. Even though she cried a lot, she was able to do her work. Now, she wears her police uniform with pride and does her job well. “Age is just a number,” she showed people who are afraid to follow their dreams because of their age.</p><h2>Some FAQs</h2><h2>Who is the wife of Borje Salming?</h2><p>In 2016, Borje Salming married Pia Salming. After getting divorced from his first two wives, he married Pia.</p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;Who Is John Watson (BBC Sports Presenter)? Wikipedia Wife And Net Worth Details Explored</strong></p><h2>Who is the first wife of Borje Salming?</h2><p>In the 1970s, Borje Salming married Margitta Salming, and they had two children, Anders and Teresa Salming.</p><h2>Early years</h2><p>Salming was born on April 17, 1951, in the village of Salmi in the city of Kiruna, close to the town of Tornetrask in the parish of Jukkasjarvi. His Sami father, Erland, was born in 1921 and died in 1956. His Swedish mother, Karin, was born in 1927. His father’s father, Anders Nikolaus, was born with the last name Saari, but he changed it to Salming after the village he and Borje’s great-grandfather built. His father worked in a mine and died there when Salming was only five years old. He is proud of being Sami and wears a traditional pewter bracelet made by the Sami. He is the first person with Sami roots to play in a top professional sports league in North America.</p><p>He played ice hockey like his older brother Stig Salming did, and he also played handball.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/smartindianews.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Borje-Salming-2-300x213.png><h2>Playing Career</h2><p>Salming played for Kiruna AIF in Sweden’s Division 2 from 1967 to 1970. From 1970 to 1973, he played for Brynas in the top division. Salming played for Brynas when they won league titles in 1971 and 1972. On May 12, 1973, the Toronto Maple Leafs signed Salming as a free agent. When the Leafs first started scouting in Sweden, they were interested in Inge Hammarstrom, not Salming. However, scout Gerry McNamara liked what he saw of Salming when he watched him play.</p><p>Salming’s first game in the NHL was with the Leafs against the Buffalo Sabres at the start of the 1973–74 NHL season. Salming was named the best player of the game after his team won 7–4. Salming had earned 39 points by the end of the season.</p><p>Before Borje Salming’s breakthrough, most North American ice hockey players thought that European players didn’t have the toughness to play in the NHL. Players from Sweden were even called “Chicken Swedes” because they were so soft. But Salming did a lot to get rid of that reputation for good. In the NHL, he played 1148 regular-season games (1099 of them with the Leafs) and 81 playoff games, where he scored 150 goals and had 637 assists.</p><p>Salming was named to the First Team of All-Stars in 1977. In 1975, 1976, 1978, 1979, and 1980, he was named to the Second Team.</p><p>Salming played for the Maple Leafs for 16 years and scored 768 points (148 goals, 620 assists).</p><p>The NHL suspended Salming for eight regular-season games and fined him $500 on September 4, 1986, because he was quoted in a Toronto newspaper in May as saying, “I used cocaine five or six years ago, but I haven’t used it in a long time, and I feel good about that.” At first, the league suspended him for the whole season. Later, the suspension was reduced. In a game between the Leafs and the Red Wings in Detroit on November 26, 1986, Salming was knocked down in front of the Leafs’ net, and Gerard Gallant of the Red Wings cut Salming’s face by accident with his skate blade. Because of the injury, the face had to be fixed with more than 200 stitches.</p><p>On January 4, 1988, Salming became the first NHL player who was born in Europe and trained there to play in 1,000 games. On January 27, Salming’s 1,011th game, his parents and friend Inge Hammarstrom gave him a car that they drove onto the ice as a surprise. This was based on what the Philadelphia Flyers did for Bill Barber when he reached the same milestone.</p><p>After 16 years with the Toronto Maple Leafs, he became a free agent in 1989 and signed with the Detroit Red Wings. He played for them for one season to end his NHL career. He finished his hockey career in the Swedish Elite League with AIK.</p><p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;Who Is Sports Director Bradly Rogers?
