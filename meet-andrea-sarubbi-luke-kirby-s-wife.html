He is a Canadian actor and a recurring character in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, an Amazon series. In addition to Mambo Italian, Shattered Glass, All Hat, and other films, he first appeared in the feature film Halloween: Resurrection.</p><p>He has dated many other Hollywood ladies since his divorce from his ex-wife, including fashion designer Andrea Sarrubi.</p><p>The 43-year-old received a bachelor’s degree in theater from the National Theatre School of Canada in 2000; he was born in Hamilton, Ontario. His parents moved to Canada in 1974 from New York City. For two of his most well-known and recent roles, including Lenny Bruce from The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and Davis Calloway, Julien Calloway’s absent father, in the Gossip Girl revival, Kirby went back to his New York roots.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Luke Kirby and Andrea Sarubbi’s Marriage</h2><p>After divorcing his ex-wife, Luke started dating costume designer Andrea Sarubbi. For a while, they were the talk of the town, but when they both kept quiet about it, the rumors stopped. Following all the connections, a further key allegation—that he had an affair with Tom Cruise’s ex-wife, actress Katie Holmes—came to light.</p><p>Kirby and Sarubbi have been dating for a long time. The couple has been together for a very long period, as evidenced by ten-year-old stories that described them as “long-term” lovers.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In an article published in the Daily Mail in August 2013, Sarubbi was referred to as his long-term partner.</p><p>No information is available regarding the couple’s real dating history, though. Kirby and Sarubbi didn’t begin appearing in public with each other until 2019.</p><p>Since then, they have shared red-carpet moments at a number of award shows and film festivals, most notably the 2019 Emmys and after-Emmy parties, as well as the 2021 Tribeca Festival.</p><p>Additionally, they are currently married, although no wedding date was given, Sarubbi was identified as Kirby’s wife in an October 2019 Forbes article about Sarah Barnett. The primary shared interest between Kirby and Sarubbi is fashion.</p><p>The actor picked up the habit of dressing to the nines when making red-carpet appearances while growing up by watching fashion television with his sister. And he did the same thing to his wife.</p><p>He mentioned that they had “a similar passion for runway displays” in his article for The Cut. This turns out to be an appropriate detail given that Sarubbi is a Hollywood costume designer.</p><p>She was a wardrobe stylist for the 2000 television documentary Treasure Seekers, according to IMDb. Her professional whereabouts remain unknown today, nevertheless.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rumors of Luke Kirby’s Divorce</h2><p>Kirby had reportedly moved out of the house they shared and appeared to have broken up with Sarubbi, his long-term girlfriend at the time, according to claims from a variety of sources. He apparently spent a lot of off-screen time with Holmes during filming breaks while this was going on.</p><p>According to Grazia magazine, which was cited by the Daily Mail, Kirby was a “single man” at the time the piece was published and he and Holmes were “free to explore the sentiments that they had for one another.”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In addition, it appears that Grazia communicated with Sarubbi in June of that same year. “Things could be going better,” she said in reference to her relationship with Kirby.</p><p>According to a different account, Look Magazine, Kirby was unsure about how to handle his romance with Sarubbi and was attempting to sort it out.</p><p>If these are to be believed, Kirby and Sarubbi have now put their difference aside and gotten back.</p><h2
