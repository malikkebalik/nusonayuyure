She was raised by a single mother, Marian Rothstein, with whom she spent the better part of her childhood.</p><p>Missy attended West Chester East, and upon graduation, she gained admission to the Pennsylvania State University.

She had a passion for modeling and even ditched her degree to pursue modeling. However, fate had other plans and she ended up becoming an actress.</p><p>Her first ever acting role was in 2003, when she got a role in the comedy romance movie, Haggard, which was written by her ex-husband, Bam Margera, who also starred in it. 2 years later, she made her debut in the reality TV series, Viva La Bam and Bam’s Unholy Union.</p><p>She has also featured in other productions including Howard SSterrzn on Demand(2006), Mighags (2009), and Bam Margera: Serious as Dog Dirt (2010).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Missy_Rothstein_Met_Her_Ex-Husband_Since_High_School></span><strong>Missy Rothstein Met Her Ex-Husband Since High School</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/jukebugs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Missy-R.jpg><p>Bam Margera whose real name is Brandon Cole started off as Missy’s friend while they were both in high school. The duo attended West Chester High School. At the time, they were just good friends before their relationship turned romantic in 2003, years after they graduated.</p><p>Before Bam became famous for being a stuntman, he would shoot videos of himself and his friends skateboarding while doing crazy stunts. His videos became popular in the CKY series, and shortly after he started his own realty stunt show on MTV titled Jackass. From there everything just went uphill for the skateboarder.</p><p>After the duo reconnected in 2003 and started dating, the relationship spiraled and in 2006, Bam proposed to Missy in front of a Cartier store. He revealed that he saw a diamond ring that fits perfectly on her finger, which he thought was a good sign.</p><p>They officially got married on February 3, 2007, at the Loews Hotel, in downtown Philadelphia, which aired on MTV’s Bam Unholy Union. The duo went on to get matching tattoos after they signed their marriage license.&nbsp; They remained married for 3 years until their relationship started to spiral downward in 2010.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Missy_Got_Divorced_From_The_American_Stuntman_in_2012></span><strong>Missy Got Divorced From The American Stuntman in 2012</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2010, Missy’s marriage to Bam started experiencing challenges which led to the deterioration of their marriage. The major reason for their problem was Bam’s late-night partying in the house and his excessive drinking.</p><p>His attitude continued for a while and Missy was always at the end of the bargain because she would always have to clean up the house the mornings after his parties before going to work. The stress began to cause a rift in their marriage.</p><p>One time the reality TV star had to call 911 for help after Bam had been drinking for 4 days in a row. Eventually, the skateboarder asked her to move out of the house because of the constant fights and disagreements. They eventually got divorced in 2012.</p><p>After the divorce was finalized, Missy celebrated and tweeted that she was finally free, and asked her fans to join her in the celebration.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Missy_Rothstein_is_Not_the_Only_Woman_Who_Has_Married_Bam></span><strong>Missy Rothstein is Not the&nbsp; Only Woman Who Has Married Bam</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The American actress is not the only woman, Bam has been married to.

She revealed that the reason for her actions was because of irreconcilable differences. These differences were later revealed to be his addiction to drugs and alcohol. She added that she did everything possible to stop him from doing drugs, and staying sober, in order to preserve their family.</p><p>Nikki requested that she gets full custody of their son, who was 5 years old at the time. In addition to her terms, she requested that Bam pays her spousal support and cover her legal fees. Her<a href=# rel=noopener> lawyer accused Bam</a> of leaving his client high and dry.</p><p>Asides from Nikki, the stuntman has also been in other relationships, including one with Jenn Rivell. The relationship led to an engagement. However, it did not get t the altar as the couple broke up in 2005. The breakup was so messy that Bam requested a restraining order against Rivell. He claimed that she abused him, snuck into his house, and even destroyed his property after the breakup.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=She_Was_Involved_in_a_Controversy></span><strong>She Was Involved in a Controversy</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Melissa was involved in a controversy after naked pictures of her surfaced online. She was asked to model for the adult magazine, Playboy, but due to how explicit the shoot was, the owners of the magazine asked Bam to take the pictures, which he did.</p><p>However, after a&nbsp; while, someone leaked naked pictures of Missy to the internet.
