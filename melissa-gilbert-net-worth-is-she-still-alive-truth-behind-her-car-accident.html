She was placed for adoption the day after her birth, with Paul Gilbert and Barbara Crane, another Hollywood couple.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Gilbert was adopted as an infant, and her adoptive parents later divorced when she was eight years old. Sara Abeles was born to her mother after she married Harold Abeles. Her parents also adopted a brother, Jonathan, who is also from Gilbert’s family. Gilbert’s adoptive father committed suicide when she was 11 years old. Her parents eventually split up.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Melissa Gilbert Career: How Did She Begin Her Profession?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Gilbert began her acting career as a child in the late 1960s when she starred in a slew of TV commercials. She first appeared on “The Dean Martin Comedy Hour” in a holiday special in 1968. In the early 1970s, Gilbert made a comeback to television with guest roles on series like “Gunsmoke,” “Emergency!” and “Tenafly.”</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>The Little House on the Prairie series</strong></p><p style=text-align:justify>It was in the 1974 pilot episode of the NBC historical drama series “Little House on the Prairie,” which was based on Laura Ingalls Wilder’s “Little House” book series, that Gilbert first gained widespread recognition as an actress.</p><p style=text-align:justify>At the center of the series was Gilbert, who played Laura Ingalls, the second-oldest daughter of Charles (Michael Landon) and Caroline (Karen Grassle) Ingalls. Melissa Sue Anderson, Lindsay Greenbush, and Sidney Greenbush played her on-screen sisters and brother, respectively.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Gilbert was chosen out of more than 500 other child actresses to play Laura. To say that “Little House on the Prairie” was a hit and lasted until 1982 is an understatement.

Among her many accomplishments is her participation in season 14 of “Dancing with the Stars.” She placed fifth overall with her partner Maksim Chmerkovskiy.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Movie Profession</strong></p><p style=text-align:justify>Starring opposite Don Knotts in the 1967 comedy The Reluctant Astronaut was Gilbert’s first film role. It wasn’t until the 1985 family drama “Sylvester” that she returned to the big screen, playing a young horse trainer. Although she has a few film credits to her name, Gilbert has not done much film work since then.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>President of the Screen Actors Guild</strong></p><p style=text-align:justify>Gilbert defeated Valerie Harper in the 2001 election for president of the Screen Actors Guild. In 2003, she easily won reelection, defeating Kent McCord.
