Our hearts go out to his family and dear friends in this moment of deep grief. His hold on the community will be forever remembered through the impact he made during his time here with us all.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-104 data-inserter-version=2></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_was_Mitchell_Judd></span>Who was Mitchell Judd?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>We are deeply saddened to announce that Mitchell Judd, who served honorably in the armed forces, passed away at the age of 33. He had joined the Australian Army Reserve (ARA) back in 2008 as a Rifleman and completed both his recruit training and Infantry Education Training (IETs) at SOl by the end of that year. Later in 2010, he was part of MTF-2, which deployed him to Afghanistan for ‚ÄúOperation Slipper,‚Äù and he returned to Australia in July 2011. He was courageous, diligent, and a true patriot who selflessly served his country with the utmost dedication and commitment. We owe him an immense debt of gratitude for his commitment to our nation‚Äôs cause; he will be greatly missed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mitchell_Judd_Died_Mitchell_Judd_Cause_of_Death></span>Mitchell Judd Died: Mitchell Judd Cause of Death?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mitchell‚Äôs passing was a shock to everyone who knew him, as he had been an active member of the ADF for nearly a decade. His dedication and commitment to the forces were evident in his nine years of loyal service, and he will be deeply missed by all who loved him. While the cause of death is currently unknown, we are awaiting word from Mitchell‚Äôs family before further details can be released. In the meantime, our thoughts and prayers are with Mitchell and his loved ones, who must now mourn the tragic loss of such an extraordinary soul. May his memory live on forever in our hearts.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><strong>Read this also: <a href=#>Resident of Johnston Iowa, Olivia white died at the age of 23</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mitchell_Judds_Career></span>Mitchell Judd‚Äôs Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>January 2012 marked a pivotal moment in Mitch‚Äôs military career, as he was posted to RMC-D. By April 2013, Mitch had successfully completed the necessary requirements for Medic IT and was subsequently posted to ALTC (ASH). As part of the 18-month course, Mitch underwent comprehensive training, after which he was posted from Brisbane to 1 CHB as a full medic in 2014. As time passed, yet another opportunity awaited in the form of a posting to SOER in Holsworthy, Sydney, during January 2016. After years of service and having achieved quite a few feats along the way, Mitch ended his journey with ARA by finally transferring out in April 2018. His current location is SERCAT 3, where he works as part of the standby reserves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rajasdentalcollege.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/WhatsApp-Image-2023-01-28-at-8.53.14-PM-1.jpeg><p>Mitch served a total of 9 years, 8 months, and 28 days in the Australian Defense Force (ADF), where he demonstrated his ability to shoulder responsibility and act with boldness and courage. For his dedication and commitment to duty, he was deservedly awarded several honors, including the Australian Defense Medal, NATO Non-Article 5 Medal with clasp ISAF, the Australian Active Service Medal with clasp ICAT, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Return from Active Service Badge, and the Infantry Combat Badge. Mitch‚Äôs nine-year service has made him a symbol of patriotism for generations in Australia.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><strong>Read this also: <a href=#>St. Joseph Coach Roy Kilgore Death: What was his cause of death?</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Gofundme></span>Gofundme<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mitchell may have passed away suddenly, but he leaves behind a lasting legacy of love for his beautiful daughter, Mia Lou. Although no amount of money can replace the hole in her life that his passing has left, we would like to help continue his legacy by giving her what Mitch wanted: the world. She was the absolute love of his life, and it was clear to everyone who knew them how proud he was of her. His passing has left a void that can never be completely filled, yet even without him being here in body, his love and spirit will most certainly remain in every aspect of Mia‚Äôs life. He may be no more, but he will always be remembered.</p><p><strong>link: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.gofundme.com/f/mitchs-legacy-for-mia</a></strong></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114 data-inserter-version=2></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Obituary_and_Funeral_Arrangement></span>Obituary and Funeral Arrangement<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The family of Mitchell will announce the obituary and funeral arrangements for their beloved family member at a future date. While they grieve their loss, they appreciate the kindness and support that have been extended to them during this difficult time; it will be of great help to them moving forward.</p><p><strong>Read this also: <a href=#>Papa Ndoye died in a Car Accident, Woonsocket, Ri</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tributes_to_Mitchell_Judd></span>Tributes to Mitchell Judd<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><strong>Rosie Bourke Wrote,</strong></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>R.
