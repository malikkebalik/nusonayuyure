The WWE pro, 36, is taking advantage of her downtime while self-quarantined to relax and nurture her unborn baby. And, since she‚Äôs got that warm California sun, she‚Äôs doing so while rocking a black bikini. Nikki showed off her ever-growing baby bump on Instagram, posting a series of photos and videos of herself in the two-piece. You can see them all below.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>‚ÄúIn a time where the world is going through a pandemic being selfless, peaceful, helpful, calming, educating yourself and social distancing is so important,‚Äù Nikki wrote on Instagram. ‚ÄúBeing pregnant and already getting influenza b my first trimester there was no question about immediately going into hibernation. I thought about my baby‚Äôs safety immediately. I have been hibernating for a week or so already and have taken this time to increase my mediation, reading time, bonding time with <strong>Artem</strong> [<strong>Chigvintsev</strong>, her fianc√©] through fun activities, hanging with family, working from home, writing, playing board games and just enjoying the chill time.‚Äù</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Nikki gave a shoutout to her twin sister <strong>Brie Bella</strong>, who also happens to be <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pregnant</a> right now. Brie was hanging out right beside her, also wearing a bikini while watching her two-year-old daughter, <strong>Birdie Danielson</strong>, play by the pool. ‚ÄúBrie and I have had to cancel a lot of exciting things in our career, Nikki wrote. ‚ÄúIt was hard to, but it was the right thing to do. This is a time to sacrifice and help.‚Äù</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=nofollow>View this post on Instagram<p id=content-paragraph-5></p></a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>In a time where the world is going through a pandemic being selfless, peaceful, helpful, calming, educating yourself and social distancing is so important.

Let‚Äôs all think of our elderly, one of the people I love most in this world is my Nana. The things I have seen on social media I couldn‚Äôt even imagine if it was my Nana in that situation. Broke my heart. If you can and it‚Äôs safe for you, help our elderly, be thoughtful in the supplies you get, and see if you can do drop offs to them. This time is about hibernating, bonding, sharing and most importantly trying our best to be selfless and peaceful. Sending so much love and light to you all! üíõ‚ú®Also working on a very cool video with Artem for 9 million followers! Goodness thank you all! Love you all! And how blessed are we that we live in a time where we can stay connected through technology.
