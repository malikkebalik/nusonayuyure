In the steamy PDA snapshot, the Fifth Harmony alum rocked a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>little black dress</a> with a mesh corset as the Seattle Seahawks wide receiver leaned in to give her a passionate kiss on the cheek. Normani smiled big in the photo and held her boyfriend close to her.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Not only did the songstress look stunning in the LBD, but she made sure to accessorize the look with droplet diamond earrings and a diamond necklace. Meanwhile, her boo looked dapper in a classic black tux, which he paired with a gold cross earring. Later, a fan account re-posted a video of the couple hitting the dance floor at his teammate&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tyler Lockett</strong></a>‘s wedding. Normani turned up the heat and was pictured grinding on DK as they were cheered on by someone off-camera (watch <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the video</a> below).</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Soon after the PDA photo and video landed online, many of Normani’s fans took to the comments of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>several posts</a> to react to the couple going IG official. “So now we now [sic] Normani has a man..!”, one admirer quipped, while another wrote, “I love Black love.” Meanwhile, some admirers were concerned for the 27-year-old’s heart. “Hope he treats her like the queen that she is,” one fan penned, while a separate one added, “She bad damn he bet not fumble that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Although she recently went IG official with DK, the “Wild Side” hitmaker and the 25-year-old first sparked romance rumors last June. The duo was spotted grabbing a bite at Giorgio Baldi in Santa Monica last year and left fans wondering on their relationship status ever since. Prior to DK, the brunette beauty was linked to&nbsp;<strong>Rameer Colon</strong> in 2021, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>, however, they called it quits not too long after.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Normani-DK-Metcalf-Relationship-Official-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Aside from her love life, Normani has been quite busy since her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Fifth Harmony exit</a> in 2018. Not only has she worked with A-listers like&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Doja Cat</strong></a>, but she also released “Wild Side” in Jul. 2021 with&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Cardi B</a>&nbsp;</strong>as the featured artist. In Nov. 2019, Normani opened up about her split from the girl group, which included&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Camila Cabello</strong></a>. “I remember always being asked, ‘Why do you wanna be in a girl group? So you can hide?’ — and that’s exactly what I was trying to do,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Cosmopolitan&nbsp;</a>in 2019. “I’m not sure what that turning point was, but I was like, ‘Normani&nbsp;is enough. You can be on-stage and perform and&nbsp;you&nbsp;can be enough.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BwZqenoqKur7WMnaJmpZWpsKK4xWagp6uklrSzrcxmpp%2BemZi2oriMqZuaZaCdvLW7jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
