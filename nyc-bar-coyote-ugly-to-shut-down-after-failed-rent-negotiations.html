Redoing insurance, working with employees, renegotiating leases. It reminded me of the beginning.”</p><p>But for Coyote Ugly, which now has 29 locations across the globe, there will be a new beginning.</p><p>In the video, Lovell, who opened the original location by saving up bartending tips, noted that there would be another Coyote Ugly bar opening in New York City with “better bathrooms” and “a little bit nicer.”</p><p>She confirmed to The Post there would be a new location but declined to share the address.</p><p>The movie, which Lovell has openly admitted she despises, celebrated its 20th anniversary in August.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3F7j3Jmam1fo8akecGaqWabn668tbGMrp6lsV2pvG6%2Fx66rZpyfrLturcWtnKtllpa2rbHDZqmepqRiu6azzq2gmqyZpLu0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
