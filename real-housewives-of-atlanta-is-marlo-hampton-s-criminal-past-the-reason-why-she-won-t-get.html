Over the years, Marlo has been at the front and center of a lot of drama that takes place on the show, despite all that she brings to the table, she hasn't gotten a peach yet.</p><p>The social media is filled with demands and requests to the executive producer Andy Cohen, to promote the favorite shade queen of 'RHOA' from a friend to housewife, despite all this, Marlo still hasn't gotten a&nbsp; peach yet.</p><p>In a recent interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Entertainment Tonight</a>, 'RHOA' housewife Kenya Moore dropped a major clue on why Marlo may haven't gotten her peach yet. The reality star revealed that Marlo's "criminal past" doesn't fit in with Bravo Network's image, so that could be the reason behind Marlo not scoring her big promotion.</p><p>In case, you're wondering what criminal past does Marlo have, then don't worry, we got you covered. In 1999, when Marlo was just 23, she was arrested for aggravated battery/ great bodily harm, which falls under the first-degree felony. What was the crime you ask, NeN revealed it as she "slashed a friend's face with a knife and disfigured her over a man.” Although Marlo was released on a $5,000 bond, that arrest continued to haunt the reality star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/b5761ab6-d8d0-4b0a-8e9e-4c81cf0cea0b.jpg><p>Marlo found herself again behind the bars four times for parole violations. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Radar Online</a>, the reality star defended herself, "I am shocked and saddened to hear of the recent distortions of events and false accusations disseminated over an altercation I was involved in over a dozen years ago… I was in my early 20s, and what took place started out as an argument with someone who was once my friend, over the phone.”</p><p>The reality star then blamed her upbringing for her actions. She added, "As disturbing as the carrying of a weapon may seem, it was quite common in the environment in which I was raised, and not only I, but also the person involved in the altercation, had each brought weapons to protect ourselves. There was a confrontation, her knife dropped, mine did not.”</p><p>Do you think Marlo's criminal past is the reason why she didn't get the peach? Let us know. 'Real Housewives of Atlanta' Season 12 airs every Sunday at 8 pm ET/PT on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqpikrm6%2BxJqjZqCfqsCmw8ivnKxln5t6osDLmqWtmV2owaK%2BjKaYq6SfYrWiuc%2BtpqdlnqTBbrPErauippditbDB0p6uop6VYr2mrcKhZJ2tlWLBsHnCq6CmoZ6WuW68wKyr</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
