She even successfully <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hosted a birthday dinner</a> for Shane's mother hoping that Shane would make an appearance to celebrate with the family, but sadly, he was a no-show. When Emily tried calling him to check about his whereabouts, he rudely hung up on her.</p><p>Since then, we have had our doubts about the stability of Emily's marriage. While we can understand that cracking the bar exam takes a lot of effort, we just couldn't understand why Shane can't spare a couple of hours for his family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/fb95d998-534e-434d-bc1e-0511a5c7c5d6.jpg><p>To make things worse, Shane doesn't even show interest in his wife's plans for their 10-year anniversary celebrations. Emily plans a trip to Vegas with Shane, where she wants to go on-stage and put up a sexy dance performance for Shane, but he simply dismisses it saying he is not comfortable with such gestures and asks Emily to carry on with her plan without him.</p><p>An upset Emily tries talking about her hurt feelings with fellow housewife Gina Kirschenheiter, only to be met with total indifference from Gina. Poor Emily still decides to go ahead with her performance plan and decides to take her girlfriends along and perform for them.</p><p>She invites new housewife Braunwyn and Tamra Judge to visit her in the studio during her rehearsals so she could get some support and feedback. The girls are in complete awe of Emily's performance, and they both begin wondering why Shane is not supporting her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/bb31c6a5-5219-46a4-bdf4-a300a9f17cc5.png><p>The housewives sense that there might be some trouble within the Simpsons' marriage, as Emily doesn't seem herself lately and Shane's absence doesn’t help the cause either. We saw an identical storyline play out in the past with Gina when her husband was always absent, and Gina used to cover up for him.</p><p>However, in this season, Gina reveals that he had been having an affair, so it wouldn't come as a surprise if Shane is following the same path.</p><p>Even in the cliffhanger of the next episode, we get to witness Shane's obnoxious behavior and Emily's frustration. While it is obvious for the other housewives and fans that Emily's marriage in trouble, the lady, however, seems to be in denial.</p><p>She comforts herself by believing that their marriage has hit a rough patch and is beyond optimistic that things can be worked out between them. We do hope for Emily's sake that things get sorted out between the couple soon. Some fans, however, don't seem to be so forgiving towards Shane. One fan wrote, "Dude. I love Emily so I hate saying negative shit about her husband but my god this man is a monster. You're a d**k, Shane. Emily deserves sooooo much better. #RHOC".</p><p>Catch all the drama and fun from the latest season 14 of 'Real Housewives of Orange Country' every Tuesday at 9/8c only on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqpWWuW60zq6qnq%2BZq7K0ec6fZKiqkaO0pnnCqKynrKliv6m7wmaqnpmjpLtufZNmnKahnK56tLXMqaqopl2otaK6xGaqoqWgqLyvecyaqauhkZyybsDRqKybpJU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
