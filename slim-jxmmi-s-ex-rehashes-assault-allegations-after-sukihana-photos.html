Reports suggested Jxmmi had been abusive towards Kee for some time, but she declined to press charges “out of fear that he would retaliate against her.”</p><p>Almost two years later, those allegations have resurfaced after Slim Jxmmi was photographed getting up close and personal with Sukihana in a series of photos shared to the latter’s Instagram page on Wednesday (February 22).</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>One picture shows the Love & Hip Hop: Miami star grinding on the SremmLife rapper inside a car park, while another finds her hugging him and holding his face as he clasps her exposed butt cheeks.</p><p>“Ask Jimmi how much he paid for my hair appointment today,” Sukihana wrote in her caption, implying the Mississippi rapper had treated her by covering the cost of her elaborate bun hairstyle.</p><p>Shortly after, Kee responded by sharing Sukihana’s post on her Instagram Stories while referencing Slim Jxmmi’s alleged 2020 assault.</p><p>“Y’all keep sending me this. they posted it for a reason,” she wrote. “This is the most attention he’s gotten since <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>SremmLife 2</a> and knocking my teeth back.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>In a follow-up Story, Kee wrote: “He’s blocked for a reason. people do not change. had to learn to stop feeling bad and making excuses for how he treats me.

I was not coming at her IN NO WAY and either was he. lmfao I’m relaying what he said to me and I was responding to her.</p><p>“Y’all have to relax and stop making everything about color[.] I’m black too. he loves darkskin women and so do I. she’s thick. he weighs 100 pounds.. that’s it.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The Shade Room</a> shed more light on Slim Jxmmi and Kee’s turbulent relationship, claiming the couple “got back together after an eight-month long separation,” during which Jxmmi “went to therapy to become a changed man for their family.”</p><p>“Just a few weeks ago, he was allegedly caught cheating on [Kee] causing the couple to separate once again,” the outlet added. “Sources say [Kee] is embarrassed by his actions in public after claiming he wanted to bring his family back together.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Kee came forward with more accusations against Slim Jxmmi in January 2022 when he was <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>arrested for allegedly attacking her during a domestic dispute in Miami</a>.</p><p>According to police, Jxmmi knocked down a door, pulled out her hair extensions and threw her phone away after she questioned him about a woman he was following on Twitter.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2022/08/slim-jxmmi-arrested-lax-georgia-drug-case-250x142.png alt="Rae Sremmurd’s Slim Jxmmi Arrested At LAX Over Georgia Drug Case" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Rae Sremmurd’s Slim Jxmmi Arrested At LAX Over Georgia Drug Case</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>August 9, 2022</p></a><p>However, Kee later claimed Jxmmi didn’t actually put hands on her and accused Dade County police of lying about what happened.</p><p>“Dade County y’all are wrong for this,” she wrote on Instagram. “I told you guys he did not hit me.
