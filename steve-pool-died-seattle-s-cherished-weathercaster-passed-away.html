His battle with the illness was both brave and inspiring, demonstrating his resilience in the face of adversity.</p><p>Dear Friends,I am here to share the sad news that my dear husband, my love, has passed away from early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. He fought this terrible disease privately for several years, and with every ounce of his being. He told me multiple times to “never count me out” and we never did. This past week it became too much and he passed away peacefully. We are so blessed to have had him in our lives. He was an extraordinary man, husband, father and good friend to many. Please know that he truly loved his job and this community and felt so privileged to be a part of your lives. You were all so good to him and thereby good to us. Our hearts are irretrievably broken. Please say a prayer for him and our family. Much love, Michelle and our daughters Lindsey and MarissaPicture credit: Jennifer Winter Photography</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading style=font-size:25px><span class=ez-toc-section id=Remembering_Steve_Pool></span>Remembering Steve Pool<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Steve Pool’s passing is a significant loss for the community of Seattle and the world of broadcasting.
