It came almost as an immediate&nbsp;response as&nbsp;the couple debuted their reality show,&nbsp;Teyana & Iman,&nbsp;in 2018.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Two years after, the first episode of We Got Love Teyana & Iman aired on June 20, 2021, as a follow-up to their&nbsp;VH1 series&nbsp;and&nbsp;gave fans a glimpse of their lives beyond social media.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><h2>The Cancer Scare</h2><p>In the latest episode titled, 'A Family Emergency,' Dr. Altman performed a biopsy on Taylor's dense&nbsp;breast tissue.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>"I&nbsp;just want this to be the last time I go through this. Cancer runs through my family, so it’s a scary thing both for me and Iman," she said during the procedure. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Fortunately, despite the "difficult" surgery, everything was okay with Taylor's breasts. However, following the procedure, the doctor informed the 'Hurry' crooner to wait at least six weeks until she can lift her kids after the surgery.</p><p>In a confessional after the procedure, Taylor spoke about&nbsp;her husband Shumpert, and daughters, 5-year-old Junie and 11-month-old Rue.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s tough, I’m definitely overwhelmed because I miss my kids so much, I miss Iman so much. That’s probably the longest I’ve been away from them. My number one priority is to hurry and get back home, but I know I need to take care of what I need to take care of as well.</p><p>When she returned home&nbsp;to Atlanta, she was relieved to see her family after a week of extensive surgery. Little Junie greeted her mother with an adorable&nbsp;"I love you Mommy!" along with a handmade&nbsp;card and some flowers.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Taylor was hesitant to hold&nbsp;Rue because of her soreness. "Rue don't understand what's going on. She's like, 'Pick me up, hello, what are you doing?' I can't do any tight hugs. I don't even know if I'm going to last six weeks," she said.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>While Taylor's health issues made her pregnancies complicated and supposedly caused her current lumps, the mother-of-two noted&nbsp;that she was happy to have done the surgery and doesn't regret it because of her family.&nbsp;</p><p>I accept every single body scar, everything that comes with mommy-hood, but the changes physically, mentally, emotionally, it’s crazy. As mommies, we really are super-women.&nbsp;</p><p>Getting candid, the singer revealed that the past year had&nbsp;been rough for her, but she managed to do a good job of balancing her multiple roles as wife, mother, and entrepreneur.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyVrq6vrYytmLKkn6d6pK3NnJyrZpipuq0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
