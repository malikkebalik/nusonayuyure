In a new ad for Pepsi ahead of his big Super Bowl 2021 halftime performance, the 30-year-old singer opted to ditch his cryptic bandages and CGI plastic surgery, showing off his real face for the first time in a while.
The one-minute teaser for the Feb. 7 show shows a montage of fans enjoying his song “Blinding Lights,” including a grocery store worker and a pool cleaner dancing to his tune like no one’s watching."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

(And as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety noted</a>, it’s the first Pepsi ad dropped before Super Bowl Sunday, which airs on CBS, and the first time the performer participated in one.)</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p>Recently, The Weeknd dropped a music video for his new song “Save Your Tears,” sporting some disturbing alterations to his face — akin to extreme plastic surgery. “But then you saw me, caught you by surprise,” he aptly sings in the video, in which he displays a thinned (and crooked) nose, bloated cheeks, puffed-up lips, surgery scars and other horrific new features.</p><p>Fans speculated that it was shade for not being <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">nominated at the 2021 Grammy Awards</a>, but other fans took it as a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">diss to ex-girlfriend Bella Hadid</a>.</p><p>However, fans shouldn’t be alarmed. The disturbing new look was achieved through prosthetics and CGI. He has previously worked with Prosthetic Renaissance, a makeup effects studio that is taking credit for the transformation on social media.</p><p>The Weeknd has been using his face of late as a statement, including a battered aesthetic in the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">short film “After Hours,”</a>&nbsp;which has the same name as his most recent album. The music video for “Blinding Lights” featured his post-bender bloodied and bruised mug — a look&nbsp;<a href=#>he re-created</a>&nbsp;for the MTV Video Music Awards last August. And in November, he&nbsp;<a href=#>covered his again-battered face</a>&nbsp;with surgical dressing to accept an award onstage at the American Music Awards.</p><p>As for Super Bowl LV, it’s unclear what face The Weeknd will be showing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3J7j2pmaXBfqbWmedaenKSmlGLAqbvWrGSrnZGheqetwp5kmp6kmr9uvMuaqq2hk2LAtr7GnqmyZaOdvKS3xJ1m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
