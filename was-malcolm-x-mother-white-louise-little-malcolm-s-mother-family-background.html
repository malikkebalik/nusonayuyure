Her full name was Louise Helen Norton Little, and she was born between 1894 and 1897 and died on 18 December 1989.&nbsp; Louise Little was a Grenadian-born American activist.<br></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Was_Malcolm_X_Mother_White></span><span><strong>Was Malcolm X Mother White?&nbsp;</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Louise Little was born in La Digue, Saint Andrew Parish, Grenada to Ella Langdon. Ella Langdon was the daughter of Mary Jane and Jupiter Langdon, both of them were kidnapped by Africans from the region of Nigeria and sold into slavery, before being freed by the British Royal Navy.</span></p><p><span>Later the couple was eventually shifted to the Grenadian village of La Digue. It has been said that Louise’s mother, Ella Langdon was raped by a “significantly older” Scotsman named Norton, and resulting in Louise’s birth.</span></p><p><span>Malcolm’s mother Louise Little is represented as a proud woman who was finally broken by white welfare people. Louise was a light-skinned woman and she was ashamed of her white blood.</span></p><p><span>So as we know, she belonged to the white ethnic background because of her father’s side, and from her mother’s side, she was African. So we can say that she belonged to mixed ethnic background. She taught her children to value their blackness and she seemed to favor the darker-skinned children over the light-skinned Malcolm.<br></span></p><p><span><strong>Also, Read About:- <a href=# rel=noopener>Who is Orlando Brown’s Parents?</a></strong></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikkamytMDIp5mopJyuxLC7w2eaqKVfrK60ecyao5ynnKJ6uXnMqKuhnaJixKm1055m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
