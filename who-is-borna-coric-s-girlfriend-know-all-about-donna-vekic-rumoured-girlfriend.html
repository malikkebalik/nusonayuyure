On November 5, 2018, he reached his highest singles ranking of No. 12. As the lowest-ranked champion in the Masters 1000, Coric made history on August 21, 2022, when he won the Cincinnati Masters. Borna Coric was having a difficult season before to the possibility of winning the Cincinnati Masters in 2022. Thanks to Coric’s accomplishments, the Western and Southern Open was a sight to behold. He defeated top seeds like Rafael Nadal, Robert Bautista Agut, Felix Auger-Aliassime, and Cameron Norrie to go to the finals. Along with other promising young players like Alexander Zverev, Hyeon Chung, and Denis Shapovalov, Coric initially emerged onto the scene. Since then, he has created a name for himself thanks to his admirable work ethic and attitude. He has also made a significant contribution to Croatia’s Davis Cup team, helping them advance to the 2018 final with a run of tenacious victories.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-646 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Coric battled various illnesses during the year, but he was able to regain his form in time for the Cincinnati Masters. The Cincinnati semifinalist has the second-lowest World No. 152 ranking since the Pepperstone ATP Rankings’ inception in 1973. Coric credits his impressive performance in Cincinnati to numerous practise sessions. In the first round of the Canadian Open, he lost to fellow Croat Marin Cilic. Regarding his success at the Western & Southern Open, Coric said, “I simply came [to Cincinnati] and I just started to serve very good.” Because of the similarities between his style and Novak Djokovic’s, Coric, a defensive baseliner, is frequently referred to as “Baby Djokovic.” Coric enjoys patrolling the baseline and using his opponent’s pace against him, much like the Serb. Before provoking an error from the opponent or firing on a short ball, he uses his timing and precision to lengthen points as much as possible.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><a href=#>Read More- What is Borna Coric net worth, prize money, salary and brand endorsements</a></p><h2 id=h-borna-coric-and-his-parents-family><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-869 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Borna Coric and his Parents, Family</h2><p>In Zagreb, Croatia, on November 14, 1996, Damir Coric and Zeljka Coric gave birth to Borna Coric. In Zagreb, his father ran a little business and played tennis for fun. After seeing his father play tennis at a nearby club, Coric became interested in the sport. He started playing tennis when he was five years old, and his parents helped him out in his early years. Growing up, Coric greatly emulated the careers of tennis greats like Rafael Nadal and Goran Ivanisevic. He carefully observed their play and made an effort to emulate it. Bruna Coric is the sister of Borna Coric. Her education was finished at the Zagreb School of Economics and Management, where she was also born in Croatia. Bruna, who is frequently spotted cheering on her brother from the players’ box during his games, is thought to be in her 20s. Coric is additionally said to be dating Croatian tennis player Donna Vekic. From the players’ box, she was seen cheering on the 26-year-old during his match with Rafael Nadal.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-donna-vekic-the-girlfriend-of-borna-coric>Who is Donna Vekic, the girlfriend of Borna Coric ?</h2><p>Coric and Donna Vekic were allegedly dating. During Coric’s match versus Nadal in Cincinnati, Vekic was observed by spectators. She was sitting in the player’s box and supporting him. If this is a blossoming relationship or a strong friendship, only time will tell. On her Instagram Stories, Donna Vekic shared a video of Borna Coric blowing out the candles on his 26th birthday cake. Vekic added a portion of the 50 Cent song “In Da Club” to the little video. The two Croatian tennis stars’ relationship is once again demonstrated by this act.</p><p>Borna Coric is the current ATP number 26 and Donna Vekic is ranked 67th in the WTA. Tennis Tonic and First Sportz reported on the rumours, highlighting that Vekic was seen in Borna’s box watching Coric’s match against Nadal in Cincinnati, according to online journal The Focus. According to The Focus, a few supporters thought it was “strange” because cameras kept moving to Donna and speculated that the two might be dating.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2Ftb%2FLrqSoZpOkunDAxKeloqtfrLWwecisZJunoqOubq%2FOq6Ccq12ctrO4xaugnqaUYrivu9ZmmKWkXZavsMHTZpuopp6WerexyqKaZqqlory2vsSdZKChoqGzs7XEp5to</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
