That’s why the 28-year-old returned for another shot at finding his person on season 8 of&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Bachelor in Paradise</a>. At the first rose ceremony of the season, Jacob gave his rose to&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lace Morris</strong></a>, but their connection was nothing more than surface level. As Lace has started to connect with&nbsp;<strong>Rodney Mathews</strong>, Jacob has found himself without a guaranteed rose at the second rose ceremony.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/jacob-rapini-5-things-bachelor-in-paradise-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>However, anything can happen in Paradise, and there are also a few women left who aren’t tied down. Jacob and his goofy “Tarzan” persona have definitely stood out on the beach, and it remains to be seen whether or not he’ll take the next step with any of the ladies. Ahead of the Oct. 11 episode, learn more about Jacob below:</p><h2>1. What Happened To Jacob On ‘The Bachelorette’?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Jacob was a contestant on season 19 of&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Bachelorette</a> with&nbsp;<strong>Gabby Windey</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Rachel Recchia</strong>. However, neither of the ladies chose to pursue him past the third rose ceremony. Jacob was eliminated <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>during week three</a>.</p><h2>2. What Did Jacob Say To Gabby On ‘The Bachelorette’?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>During his short time on the show, he faced some backlash because of a comment he made to Gabby when he told her that he was interested in a relationship with Rachel instead of her. He told Gabby that she was “smoking hot,” but added, “If you were the only person here, I don’t think I could have the heart to continue.” After his elimination, he apologized for his words on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“What I said was ignorant and not appropriate for the moment,” Jacob wrote in his apology, which was directed to Gaby. “I realized you don’t know what someone could be going through or where their headspace is at. Listening instead of explaining would have gone a lot further. Personally, I wouldn’t want anyone to say what I said to me. I have no excuses. What was said was said. I can’t go back on the past. I can only learn from this moment to understand everyone deserves to be respected. We all make mistakes but as a man I won’t take this for granted.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/jacob-rapini-5-things-bachelor-in-paradise-embed2.jpg><h2>3. What Is Jacob’s Job?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Jacob is a Mortgage Broker at Allied First Bank, according to his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LinkedIn</a>. He’s held the position in Scottsdale, Arizona since March 2021. Before that, he worked as a Mortgage Loan Officer at Axos Bank from Oct. 2019 to March 2021 in San Diego, California.</p><h2>4. Where Did Jacob Go To College?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Jacob attended Texas Tech University from 2013 until 2017.

Jacob Is Serious About Fitness</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Jacob is a fitness fiend, and keeping his routine in check is high on his priority list. “His ideal partner should want to maintain a healthy lifestyle and be able to have fun working up a sweat both in and out of the gym,” Jacob’s ABC bio says.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K3oq%2FOm2SrmaCeu6p5wZqaoZ2cpL9utc1mp5qqkZm2tLGMbW9vbWhshHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
